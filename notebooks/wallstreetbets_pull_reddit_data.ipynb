      "- As far as major market driving news goes, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. **FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%**. Extremely fuckin’ bullish. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that **the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track**. The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy also helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. The Fed also played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target. Given that the Fed’s not yanking our dicks, I think this is bullish? I don’t know man, I’m sure someone who’s smarter than me can figure it out, I just write the transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "- On Thursday, The Department of Labor released their weekly unemployment report. **Initial jobless claims were 770,000 vs. the 700,000** that were expected. A shockingly high 10% increase. Not good looks. Continuing claims clocked in at 4,124,000 vs. the projected 4,034,000 during the prior week.\n",
      "\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "- Overall, this week felt more brutal than most. We were clearly in a bull bear reverse head and shoulders bear ascending trap wedge upside down overhand bull inverse descending double triple bear top, but I’ll admit, at the time it was hard to see. I just want it to end. **SPY** actually finished the entire week down only 1%, with all the major indices following suit. Bears got fucked. Bulls got fucked. Theta gang got fucked. If you made money under these market conditions you deserve to be arrested.\n",

      "- In EV land, Volkswagen (**VWAGY**) had a stellar week, finishing up over 20% after announcing that the company is making a push to become the market leader in electric vehicles in Europe. The company recently announced plans to build 6 factories to produce EVs by 2030, impressing investors. The music stops here, as **TSLA** and other EV stocks got absolutely curb stomped, closing the week down roughly 6.5%. Situations like this are the reason why every time I think about buying TSLA calls, I pay a hooker half the amount to step on my balls in heels. I save money, support local business, get a good view, and experience the exact same sensation! Fuck.\n",

On Wednesday, it was announced that *all* theatres in California would be open by the 19th. Unironically, this is all insanely bullish news. I still think AMC is kind of a retarded investment, but those who stuck to your guns were rewarded handsomely, kudos. AMC Closed the week up 26% at 14$.\n",

I don’t even know how you “accidentally” omit hundreds of millions of dollars and make such a critical “accounting error” on such a large scale, but here we are. PLUG finished the week down 20% at 38$. I unfortunately don’t know if this was because of them straight up creating money out of thin air, or because of the wider market selloff, since plenty clean companies also got hammered just as bad.

To all the newly minted WSB bagholders, let me impose some wisdom on you. My general rule of thumb is “don’t buy anything you won’t want to explain if it tanks”. If I somehow lose money on Amazon or Apple or MSFT, whatever, I can live with those decisions. But if I have to tell someone I lost 4k on fucking Alibaba or 3k on fucking Doordash I’m gonna feel like an actual retard as I should. Don’t play anything you won’t want to explain, it’ll quell your itchy trigger finger while looking at the meme plays.\n",
