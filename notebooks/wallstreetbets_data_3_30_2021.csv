So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

&#x200B;

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&#x200B;

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

Edit: The yellow line is the MACD line and the red line is the signal line. When the MACD line crosses it upwards the momentum is up meaning price increase. Obviously vice versa on a downward cross.",3/31/21 1:12

Let‚Äôs just say it rhymes with Barrel Finch...

So, we‚Äôve been talking about the whole situation and the stir that WSB has created in Wall Street. She is a bit older and doesn‚Äôt really understand what is going on with this site or sub. However, she mentioned to her boss that I have been part of this sub and that I am active in it. 

Her boss mentioned that he has been trying to follow us but doesn‚Äôt really understand the platform or our. He is a frat bro GenX‚Äôr and caters to boomers, so he is only tech savvy with the specific software that the company uses as well as other news sites/apps that keep him up to date with the market. He always hires Frat bros and Kids of his (wealthy) friends as interns. Because he thinks that Chadbros, Stacies, and Frat bros make it in the industry better than most.

He is now planning on hiring a ‚ÄúTechy‚Äù (he used this fucking word and it made me cringe) person to use and follow this Sub and understand us Tards. No fucking joke! He wants to hire a guy to just troll Reddit and figure out what the fuck we are up to. 

Then he basically said that he wanted someone $YUNGer and more autistic than me who can actually understand what we do and then break it down to him (this I‚Äôm paraphrasing). He really is overestimating our collective intelligence...

So, just letting all you $YUNGer folks that are looking for internships in the financial sector, your job this summer may not be to just bring the wrong coffee order and tickle the $ANUS of your superiors with your üíã. You might have to spend it here in this sub of üìØüêÇ, üåàüêª, and ü¶ç all summer. I hope you have fun and realize that you might be tard like the rest of us. And follow the rules because the SEC will shove a green üçÜ  up your $ANUS if you step out of line.

Below I will place all the potential cannabis catalysts and why I think TLRY is poised for a run this upcoming month. 

Catalysts: 

‚Ä¢ New York recreational cannabis legalization (4/1/2021)

‚Ä¢ NM Mexico recreational cannabis legalization (this week) 

‚Ä¢ SAFE Act - banking act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 

‚Ä¢ CLAIMS Act - insurance act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 

‚Ä¢ APHA earnings call (4/13/2021)

‚Ä¢ APHA/ TLRY merger vote meeting (4/14/2021)

‚Ä¢ Proposed merger date (4/20/2021) 

‚Ä¢ Mexico recreational cannabis legalization deadline (4/30/2021) 

Current shares outstanding: 171M 
Current share float: 144M 
Current short float: 20% 
Institutional ownership: 14% 

Currently sitting at 22.04, right at trend line support. As everything in the Nasdaq, the sell off in share price has been due to the Nasdaq sell off. 

Now that we are entering a new month, we may see tech recover, and especially the marijuana sector, which has a lot of news coming. April, historically, is a good month for the stock market. 

I am mainly focused on TLRY though due to that merger with APHA that will make it the largest cannabis company in the world. 

Aphria owns Sweetwater Brewery while Tilray owns Maritoba Harvest (hemp). 
Once merged, the two companies will trade as Tilray and will headquarter in the US. 
They will no doubt use their massive cash position to acquire US cannabis companies. 
Aphria dominates not only the Canadian market but also the German one. 
Tilray currently has the Spain market as well as New Zealand and UK. 
Not only is this a US cannabis play but also a Europe cannabis play - the two most profitable cannabis markets in the world. 

Let‚Äôs send TLRY to the fucking moon!

EDIT: as of 7:45PM ET, NY senate has passed the legalization of cannabis!!! Official legalization incoming by Thursday at the latest.

My thoughts is that positive APHA ER will cause the MJ stock fomo then the merger announcement the next day fomo will get even worse",3/31/21 9:05

**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**

**MORNING 07:00-12:00**

First thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.

https://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd

Next we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.

https://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542

Whoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.

**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**

Using my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.

look at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.

For those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his üçÜ chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY

Yep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close

And like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.

As Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?

I'm the one that originally posted BB DD back in November a week prior to aws announcement, in that thread, I predicted a eoy pt of 12-18, I still stand by that. 


215m rev, expected 245.


BB's downfall has always been lack of revenue growth, and the reaction matched the results.

**However let's dig a bit deeper.**

They said that they're currently in the process of selling a large portfolio of **messaging** and communication patent profile, to a **north american** buyer

And hence under that stipulation, they stated that they were unable to generate revenue using those patents. That explains why they missed.


2. I did not expect a settlement from Facebook, however I do think this buyer could be Facebook, it would make sense if you look at the lawsuits that occurred between Facebook and BB, one of them was the ability to switch from having games inlay in a messenger ( FB messenger) which BB won. 


3. Expecting 9-15% GAAP growth in cyber sec, yes this isn't as much growth as CRWD but BB is worth 4-5b vs 40b for crwd.


They mentioned USPS, looking forward to more details about that. 


Notes:
I think even the fact they mentioned the patent sale on ER would indicate that they're in very advanced talks, or they would lose their negotiating power. 

The patent was said to be a lump payment + tail of multiple years which is amazing.

Ivy partnerships will be announced later this year and be in cars by 2022, I already predicted this but a confirmation is nice.


Overall this quarter also saw one less competitor in McAfee

They're also putting more of an initiative in marketing and brand awareness. 



They have 800m in cash, 800-900m in revenue, valued at 4-6b. With potential for explosion via IVY and more cyber sec growth in the coming years.



I think there will be more negativity to come, especially from analysts that will want to flaunt their previous price targets, they will double down on that. 

I think this will present a nice buying opportunities for anyone that wants in the coming days.

59,Lets talk about SPACE baby - the next wave of companies ARKX will pick up,58,mgn5qd,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgn5qd/lets_talk_about_space_baby_the_next_wave_of/,49,"By now we have all seen the things Cathy put in her new space exploration ETF from obvious inclusions like KTOS and LHX to head scratchers John Deere to Netflix and her own 3D printing ETF. Obviously the fund is actively managed so new companies will be acquired, reweighted, and blah blah blah. What follows is a few companies I can see being added at some point.

**Northrop Grumman (NOC)** \- I was admittedly surprised not to see NOC in the holdings for ARKX. They are LMT's little brother who has their own impressive portfolio of government contracts and military vehicles. They have also been making acquisitions to pivot towards Space. In 2017, they bought Orbital ATK and used that to form NG Innovative Systems. With that acquisition, NOC acquired multiple rockets, engines, and Space Payloads. Government contracting is very West Virginia-y and NOC already has existing ties to every defense company in ARKX. Notice, LMT just bought Aero(tyne)jet Rocketdyne to furhter build out their space capabilities. If you look at their earnigns release, NOC grew its Space Systems division 18% from $7.4B to $8.7B from 2019 to year end 2020. Those numbers should continue to grow as the government seeks a number of space capabilities.

**Raytheon (RTX)** \- Another classic American company connected to the teet of the USG. Raytheon Missiles have been sending people to the Gulag long before it was cool to do in Warzone. Like NOC and LMT, RTX has also made strategic space acquisitions, acquiring small sat company Blue Canyon Technologies in addition to owning Collins Aerospace. In its first year, RTX Intelligence & Space division had $10.8B in net sales and 9.4% profit margin while Collins Aerospace had $19.2B in net sales and a 7.6% operating profit margin. Feels worth noting, Collins Aerospace literally makes fucking [space suits](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Space/Space-Suits) along with other critical spacecraft components. the Intelligence and Space division will continue to rack up prime contracts with the USG and sub contracts with all the other players in the Space sector and revenues will grow.

**Maxar (MAXR)** \- This company can best be described as LHX-lite as they have pivoted from a satellite imagery and consulting provider to becoming a company that makes boxes and things that will enter Space. MAXR actually has [some of its tech](https://blog.maxar.com/space-infrastructure/2021/inside-perseverance-how-maxar-robotics-will-enable-a-historic-mars-mission) on the Perseverance Rover exploring Mars right now. Additionally they are providing power and propulsion elements for the NASA Lunar Gateway project. Their 2020 annual hasn't been released yet, but the 2019 report highlighted contract wins and their development of their Space Infrastructure business in the mil/gov space. The company is still finding its way as it [reported a loss](https://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Maxar-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx) on 1.7B in revenue in 2020.  Growth in the previously mentioned Space Infrastructure division helped pair down the company's overall losses. Its most notable bit of news lately has been the [failure](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/sirius-xm-satellite-sxm-7-fails-built-by-maxar-and-launched-by-spacex.html) of it's satellite built for Sirius XM that was launched by SpaceX. If you invested in zero and pre-revenue EV companies, this is the play for you.

There are additional speculation plays you could make in a number of SPACS with BlackSky, Momentus, and SpaceX junior (Rocket Labs). Not going into further detail cause they have <1B market cap.

I would note that these companies along with the other ones like LHX, LMT, HO, BA, KTOS etc will have big revenues but slimmer profit margins due to the complexities of putting shit into space and government contract restrictions on contract profits so you won't see the large PE ratios of software/tech companies. None of these are get rich quick stonks so patience will be required.

**TL;DR: ARKX has some questionable holdings now. Buy shares of these companies that could see an ARK boost.**

I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. I‚Äôm might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and I‚Äôm like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others.

Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air.

Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. That‚Äôs what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. 

AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. 

AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I don‚Äôt know expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I don‚Äôt think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.

I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle.

I like movies and I like the stock!

63,$AAL - The American Airlines Degenerate Gamble - AAL Trade Thesis,108,mgh8kt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgh8kt/aal_the_american_airlines_degenerate_gamble_aal/,81,"What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô fellas, hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I‚Äôve got a short little trade thesis that I can‚Äôt get out of my mind due to how odd it is, and was looking for some second opinions on it. Reposting this due to it getting removed yesterday.

&nbsp;

In my spare time, I‚Äôve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I‚Äôve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there‚Äôs anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn‚Äôt that crazy since it could‚Äôve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that this isn‚Äôt a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it‚Äôs not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn‚Äôt find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&nbsp;

**I‚Äôm not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

Basically what happens is surge in demand, which current supply struggles to cover, causes prices to sky-rocket from being under-valued to highly over-valued.
In my opinion some coin and its' four-year cycle is the best example. The main event of the cycle is halving (halving the rewards of mining the coin ), which is causing supply-shock and aftermath in the form of speculative bubble.

I strongly believe we are about to see a supercycle in Uranium in the following years. Spot price of that commodity is right now under-valued to such an extent Cameco ( one of its largest global providers) is buying it from the spot market in order to meet the contracts and keeping some of its mines closed (waiting for the prices to rise). Currently there are about 440 active nuclear reactors and 50 being constructed (more than 10% of the actual number) mainly in China and India (respectively 16 and 6 as of March 2021). Interesting pair, isn't it? If the rest of the world does not want to stay behind they will have no choice but to follow that direction.
Nuclear energy is not opponent of wind and solar energy. It is their carbon-free companion versus the coal.

2. Selling  $30 billion of shares in 4 days is too much too fast and a 50% correction on VIAC is not justified.

3. VIAC did a $3 billion offering while it was over extended up at $100 per  share and they now have \~$3 billion more cash than DISCA does. This is a chad move and a rare opportunity for them to acquire or build something  incredible--I'm not going to speculate as to what, but I'm confident they will do something dank.

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses too tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

From it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22 it has been a wild ride. Fubo is an incredible streaming service especially when it comes to sports. As a user and subscriber myself what they offer for $65 a month well worth it in addition to the $18 sports package. That to me is personally enough to ever need at a much cheaper price that cable. I'm just some stoner in my 20's what more would I need? Now imagine a shit ton of us starting to cut cable and move towards these streaming services? 

There is a growing market of ""cord cutters"" that is going to be in the millions. If Fubo can grow their marketing and grab a large chunk that will help its revenue grow substantially. Revenue that just topped 100m for it's first quarter ever. It should be noted that FUBO reacted positively to earnings and then the tech fuckery began. 

With their acquisition of Vigtory, a sports betting company, their goal to achieve a single platform tv screen and betting screen is extremely tangible. Imagine the amount of guys in their 20s and 30s who'd sign up for this shit. Not only would they be added subscribers but they could go from a $65 a month subscriber to a few hundred or a few thousand. This is hopefully going to be implemented in the fall or early winter. 

With the recent rotation out of growth stocks, FUBO will rip back, as many of these stocks have fallen 50-60%, people will quickly rotate into them again. I don't see it being a slow bleed for much longer. With these sharp drops due to the selloff, it's looking attractive with a decent short float of 35%. This could very easily trigger a decent sized squeeze. 

Institutions love FUBO as well. It's riding at 63% institutional ownership at this point despite the beatdown. You would see them have exited their positions by now if this doesn't bounce back hard. 

$80+ EOY book it.

No, this isn't financial advice, I just love the fucking stock and think this it's just criminally undervalued at the current share price.

CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) is specific, efficient and versatile gene-editing technology we can harness to modify, delete or correct precise regions of our DNA. . This technology can be used to eradicate species, make designer babies, reverse extinction, cure diseases, the list goes on and on. The CRISPR mechanism moves much faster then regulators can control which allows rapid advancement within the technology. Unlike other medical advances, CRISPR RNA is relatively cheap ( hundreds of dollars ) which allows for widespread study and HUGE demand for the product. The price of CRISPR has decreased 99% and research can be done in weeks as opposed to years. CRISPR was originally discovered in the 80s but did not gain traction until the early 2000's. The reason I bring this point up is because good ideas cant be used because of the tools they have at the time. For CRISPR the time is now. Since I am not a scientist or a biotech engineer I am going to keep this DD short and allow you to research on your own. If your really retarded and skip these big words to scroll through GME memes, take away this; In 2020, CRISPR-Cas9 won the Nobel Prize, the fucking Nobel Prize. They are solving HIV, cancer, HUMAN AGING, with this ""simple"" tool. CRISPR IPO'd at $14 and climbed over $220 in January. Since January CRISPR has gotten almost halved and is now trading around $110. This isn't just another stock to make some gainz on, this is *Already* changing the world around us, they have already created human genetically edited babies.

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Relevant tickers are likely due to those companies being direct GameStop competitors [https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop](https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop)

[Edit: Added a Yellow Question Mark because Ape's like more pictures](https://preview.redd.it/qn1gcag0j2q61.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=e258647aa0a0080dd90d4d1a8d0239bf850e6a3e)

By the comparison you see that when MickeyDee's rises a significant amount, outside of it's given trend, we see the market dip pretty soon after, usually within 2-4 weeks.

Some people that finished high school argue that it's due to investors not being sure of the economy and wanting to hedge their bets. Think of it like investing in gold when shit hits the fan, only it's the Golden Arches.

And something about investors finding cyclicals, but I still haven't found my wife's yet.

If you zoom into July you could also argue that it did/didn't predict a slide in stocks, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other 4 times so I left it out.

*""Does this mean I should go buy puts on everything?""*

Hell if I know, market might go through the roof for the rest of the year. I'm posting on WallStreetBets, not The WallStreet Journal, so that should convey my ability to deep throat crayola's.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Since 2016, 3 out of 4 times MickeyDee's Rises Sharply, Market Dips after.

Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

ABCL is not a biotech company, nor is it a pharma company. They want to be both, they want to make data, make drugs, make new scientific discoveries, they want royalties, partnerships, research. This company has huge plans and is in the right spot financially to make it all happen.

Check out their earnings:

ABCL [(Link to Earnings)](https://investors.abcellera.com/news/news-releases/2021/AbCellera-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Business-Results/default.aspx) TLDR its fucking massive, its a phenomenal report. 800 million on hand with Little debt with the debt at 0% interest. *0. F'ing. Percent.* [(Link to pretty color ppt from earnings call)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/359178033/files/doc_presentation/2021/3/AbCellera-2020-Business-Update-(March-29-2021).pdf)

ABCL has huge potential to become a **massive juggernaut** as a biotech/pharma company.

Their antibody discovery platform allows them to rapidly discover therapeutic targets and push them into preclinical development. This is best demonstrated by the development of Bamlanivimab, where the antibody went from unknown to discovered product to clinical trials in **60 days. 60. days.** Typical drug development takes years on average and they had a covid drug in clinical trials by the summer of 2020 after starting discovery efforts in late winter.

Let me start a new paragraph and reemphasize this shit ***60. F'ing. Days***. Thats the definition of industry disruption, to introduce a new product that drastically improves and decreases development time is huge. I fucking snorted the crayons (orange you tards any other flavor isn't worth the time) out of my nose when I saw this, full disclosure I work in the industry and we can't fucking match this.

And since I know most of you can't read, here's a couple bullet points your partner's girlfriend or boyfriend can read to you tonight:

* ABCL 2020 Annual Revenue was $**233,155,000.**
* ABCL 2021 Q1 Project Revenue from one income stream AKA Bamlamni-60fuckingday-cumfasterthanyourpreeteen-vimab is a minimum of ***190,000,000, more likely over 200mil.***

Their projected 2021 Q1 revenue is essentially their whole entire year in 2020.

Now during the earnings call one investor had a decent slightly stoopid question of what about when COVID is over. Ladies and Gents sit down and shut up. COVID is projected to be endemic for the decade if not forever, it is here to stay. Which means COVID drugs are here to stay and here to generate money. The CEO made sure to point this out, also that ABCL is not a fucking COVID company. They many projects in different fields of therapeutics (oncology, animal health, nerve regeneration, etc) and they acquired a company called Trianni last year. A humanized mouse model company that OTHER companies will use for research and drug development.

&#x200B;

If my retard summaries above weren't enough check out the historical short volume data. If you wanted squeeze potential, ABCL might just have a bunch of lemons so find some fucking sugar, ice cubes, and water. Might just be drinking some lemonade on the porch of your 100 year old dilapidated Southern Style farm house porch  of a home that you bought with 5% interest with a waived inspection and no DIY skills to speak of.

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company‚Äôs platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.

‚ÄúAbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what‚Äôs possible,‚Äù said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place.

The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. ***All trading strategies are used at your own risk***.

121,Optimizing for maximum ROI when choosing options strikes,69,mg7ual,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg7ual/optimizing_for_maximum_roi_when_choosing_options/,44,"Q: How are y'all choosing your strikes when buying/selling options? Do you try to find the returns-maximizing trade?

\- about 70% of people I've asked have said smth along the lines of ""I look for an expiry date i like with low enough IV across the board, then kinda just wing it on determining strike based on the break-even"" (for buying options) or ""I look across multiple expiry dates for really high IV to sell those options""

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said they use spreadsheets, build sensitivity tables, and/or monte carlo simulation scripts to find an optimal trade

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said ""literally just YOLO""

\---

I'm building a tool that will automatically figure out the optimal strikes and maturities to buy/sell at, after you input your price target.

e.g. This is not my view but let's say hypothetically you think TSLA is worth $520,  with +/-$200 at 95% confidence interval .... what puts at what strike(s) should you consider buying to maximize ROI?""

125,Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is why.,812,mfr62k,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfr62k/palantir_pltr_is_a_low_bottom_company_and_has/,246,"First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit√§t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  ‚ÄúWe are going to deliver the world‚Äôs best software with the world‚Äôs most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that‚Äôs worth to them. And I think you‚Äôll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.‚Äù -Karp the day they went public",3/29/21 22:48
126,Blackrock selling off $PENN,379,mfwc2a,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfwc2a/blackrock_selling_off_penn/,211,"Hear me out... a couple others have mentioned that it may have actually been Blackrock that liquidated shares on Friday. Given the size of the sell offs, some are saying that it only makes sense that it must have been a fund the size of Blackrock or Vanguard.

Blackrock and Vanguard also happen to be the two largest holders of shitco $PENN (Blackrock owns 12.5% while Vanguard holds 9%). Now I believe that this stock was ponzi scheme from the beginning, given that it ran up 1500% based on no fundamentals and a significant loss in income.

I just wanted to point this out because FUCK Dave Portnoy. He has been all over Twitter tryna convince his followers to buy the dip on shitty $PENN stock while insiders have been dumping it like their life depends on it. AVOID THIS STOCK LIKE THE PLAGUE.

Now I'm not quite sure what Blackrock dumping shitco $PENN has on the broader market but it would be interesting to see if there were other companies that are largely held by Blackrock/Vanguard that are being dumped right now.

Edit: For those of you that are stupid enough to still be buying into this garbage - look at the recent insider transactions. They're dumping all their shares to all you retards that think Portnoy is on your side.

139,Spy-When to Buy.,35,mg81j5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg81j5/spywhen_to_buy/,17,"This isn't financial advice and I am not responsible for you blowing up your account.

TL:DR: I am going to BUY end of Month APRIL call contracts after 1-2% drop from 4/1 open. YOLO Stim money. 

Rule one of forecasting:  

***PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T A INDICATOR OF FUTURE RESULTS.***

So you all saw the Graph telling you April is the best time to buy as it shows a 2% gain on average. While this is true what is left out is why April is higher. The reason April is higher is because it is were a lot of the bounce backs have occurred in April while March tends to suck.

I went and pulled all of Spy from 1993 to 2021 and this is what I found.

Spy mostly ends up back were it started between open and close but has large swings between days.

The months with the highest ratios being positive tends to be April and November for the data set as shown below.

https://imgur.com/a/ok7lAu1

As you can see from 1993 through 2020 April still had some red months but is it is mostly green dildos. 

Here is the actual Avg % gain between the first of the month and end of the month from 1993-2021 excluding outliers like the crash of 2020 in march and the recovery in April. Anything outside of -9% and 10% was an outlier.

https://imgur.com/a/H6EGgLS

Included is the avg % difference between the months lowest point and opening price for the month.

https://imgur.com/a/7xn5s9A

For the most part April stands a really good chance of being green but don't buy any options until SPY is below what ever it is going to be on 4/1 by 1-2% as current option contacts by the end of April have to move 1.5-2% for you to just break even. 

April tends to only increase by ~1.5% by close on 4/30.

 For you smooth brains this means you are likely fucked if you buy EOM contracts the first of the month. So wait for red day and then buy and enjoy the ride. 

If you time the lowest price in April the likely max price change you can get by the end of the month is 4% but there are years were it went up 8%.

This is what I am going to throw my stim money on and see what happens.",3/30/21 12:39

This morning, $HGEN released their great [P3 topline results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005301/en/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3-Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19) showing a 54%(!!!) relative reduction (Lenzilumab vs. standard of care) in the studies primary endpoint (ventilator free survival through day 28) in the mITT population - which was **statistically significant**. The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on 88.56m volume vs. 32.15m float). This is still a GREAT entry point imo and still below the February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased... I expect the price to rise a lot this week.

The next step for $HGEN is EUA application and (hopefully) approval. This is the big ticket and when the stock will really üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Other updates worth noting today - Humanigen announced that they drew the $25m loan from Hercules Capital and suspended their ATM agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-8k-2021-march-29-18715-40)). They also announced an offering of 5m shares ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-424b5-2021-march-29-18715-832)). $HGEN is gearing up for Lenz production.

Things to look out for in the coming days/weeks are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA application and approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future...

Originally posted Thursday on r/stocks:

Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered¬Æ anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID ‚Äì patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don‚Äôt matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here‚Äôs a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What‚Äôs also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn‚Äôt target the virus ‚Äì it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: ‚ÄúGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds‚Äù

Here‚Äôs another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‚ÄêCSF might be a key feature of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2‚Äêinduced cytokine storm in COVID‚Äê19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I‚Äôve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success
4. Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID ‚Äì getting worse**

As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here‚Äôs an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx). Humanigen in collaboration with BARDA to increase manufacturing capacity
2. License agreement with KPM Tech/Telcon RF Pharamceutical company for Lenzilumab production in South Korea and the Phillipines. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005167/en/Humanigen-Executes-Licensing-Agreement-for-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-in-COVID-19-with-KPM-TechTelcon-RF-Pharmaceutical-for-South-Korea-and-the-Philippines)\]
3. Partnership with Thermo Fisher to scale up manufacturing. \[[Source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/humanigen-thermo-fisher-reach-agreement-to-scale-up-manufacturing-monoclonal-antibody)\]
4. Partnership with Emergent Biosolutions for development and manufacturing. \[[Source](https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humanigen-and-emergent-biosolutions-announce-contract-0)\]

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here‚Äôs a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling ‚Äì US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn‚Äôt include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN‚Äôs market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock‚Äôs low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS ‚Äì CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don‚Äôt want to downplay this, I think it‚Äôs very promising and I‚Äôm very bullish on it, but I‚Äôm admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There‚Äôs 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

156,Transocean's Hedge Fund Historical Manipulation and What is in Progress,242,mfsgf7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfsgf7/transoceans_hedge_fund_historical_manipulation/,53,"A couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.

**The Hedge Fund Play:**

In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.

Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.

To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres & Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.

I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.

Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.

Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.

In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

[RIG](https://preview.redd.it/eghbkjl3nzp61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84565866abc86314337836e1206d4000161a934)

**Industry and Company Background:**

Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to Covid-19 lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand.

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year.

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.

With the up-trending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year.

Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil.

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.

From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets.

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.

**Recently - New Play:**

A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analyzing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.

My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Some legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.

The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.

This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.

The key here is that you believe BB will be going up in the next 6 months. If you don't think that and don't buy the other posted DD's then don't bother with my strategy.

My theory is that the stock will be back over 10$ a share in the next month or so. I'm willing to buy a 1000 shares at this price. Instead of just buying them for 9.6 this morning, I sold 10 CSP (Cash Secured Puts) for $950 that expire on 4/1. This means if the stock is less than 10$ at market close Thursday, I'll be buying 1000 shares for 10k.

If I wanted to be really safe, that'd put my cost basis at $9.05 a share. But this is WSB and I want to play earnings so fuck that. I immediately used my $950 cash to buy some FD's. 19x 4/1 10C.

I've been wondering for the past couple weeks what the bull case for the nasdaq 100 is. Let's see if you smooth brains can handle this next level vaccine boosted (both doses) thought process. 

**Booming economy leading to inflation**

This should be obvious. Pandemic goes away, everyone goes out and spends lots of money, prices increase to meet demand, inflation ensues. Some are arguing this will only be temporary, like Papa Powell. Papa is so against real inflation he's said he's gonna let inflation run hot for a while, maybe as high as 2.4% this year.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio)

But you know what? Powell doesn't control interest rates (kinda but not really). And if the bond market starts to feel like yields are not getting enough bang for their buck, Uncle Sam will have a hard time finding buyers at the next treasury auction. If interest rates rise and depending on how quickly, the Nasdaq will have a real pullback since all these unicorns won't have access to cheap money anymore.

**Pandemic 2.0**

Just when you thought it was safe to kiss grandma, new variants are making covid cool again. Brazil is seeing an uptick in deaths among younger patients as a result of new variants. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift)

Parts of Europe are going into lockdowns again because of poor vaccine rollouts, pussies. Lets imagine covid doesn't go away as planned and continues to cause problems. This would lead to another general stock market pullback. Maybe not as big as last year, who knows? But all indexes are priced far above pre pandemic levels.

**So what's the bull case?**

I'm asking you, what's the bull case? Perhaps I'll be able to figure it out after my third covid vaccine

165,ARKX Holdings Early Thoughts üöÄüõ∞üõ∏,84,mfwa9n,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfwa9n/arkx_holdings_early_thoughts/,43,"ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th).

At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let‚Äôs do some digging. 

From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx)

*Why invest in ARKX*

*Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.*

*The Adviser defines ‚ÄúSpace Exploration‚Äù as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.*

**why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as ‚Äúcash-like‚Äù for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. 

Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). 

The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). 

Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies).

**39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that‚Äôs actually the first thing I‚Äôve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. 

**only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, üöÄ Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). 

**their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it‚Äôs absolutely needed for space tech whether it‚Äôs printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. 

**actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings (excluding USD) have current revenue and financial stability as opposed to negative FCF for the next few years to come (last 2 holdings). Again a sign of lowered risks taken given the current equities market. 

**TLDR**: while initially underwhelming ARKX composition could very well be increased and even reshuffled as market conditions normalize (and/or market crash). Doesn‚Äôt look like very spacey nor ultra innovative right now but it feels like Cathie Wood hasn‚Äôt shown her hand yet. 

Not a recommendation to buy, hold nor sell any securities. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ because it‚Äôs space + WSB.",3/30/21 2:38

169,Biocryst ($BCRX) continues to remain undervalued,85,mfuz84,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfuz84/biocryst_bcrx_continues_to_remain_undervalued/,37,"First off, I am not giving you advice. I'm not a financial advisor, nor do I work in the pharma industry. I'm just sharing some research I did, and I'm open to all feedback and comments. Additionally (in full disclosure) based on what I found, I'm holding 450 shares because I'm still afraid of options.

Lets start off with some TLDR for the bullish thoughts and bearish thoughts.

Bullish points:

Based on fairly conservative COGS I have a share target of $19, but if that turns out to be overly conservative a more realistic value could easily push the share target to $24-$30. These values also assume fairly conservative adoption among the patient pool. The recent injection of liquidity also gives them plenty of runway to start cashing in on a fully approved drug (Orladeyo). Additionally none of this accounts for their developmental drug (BCX9930) at all which [has been racking up some big wins in clinical trials fairly recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and could push this to another level entirely. Considering that their Orladeyo drug on its own would support nearly double the current share price this makes a 10$ entry point fairly attractive with a potential bonus moonshot if BCX9930 takes off.

Bearish points:

Despite being approved, the rate of adoption of Orladeyo could take years to secure my estimated market share (I cant find any data to help estimate adoption rates). Drug trials can be a shot in the dark, and while currently there is no bad news regarding their up and coming drug BCX9930, a bad result would certainly draw enough negative sentiment to tank the price, despite Orladeyo easily supporting a share price of 19$ on its own. Additionally BCX9930 will need to complete trials for all of the numerous diseases they plan to market it for. Those trials will cost time and money and drag out for years. Lastly drug prices are in the focus of media pressure in the US which could likely have a negative impact on the pharma industry as a whole.

Now for the details. I'm going to talk through Liquidity, Revenue estimates, Cost estimates, and eventually arrive at my price target estimates. Lastly I'll speculate on some risks.

* Liquidity: In the 3rd quarter, they lost around 45M and had around 150M cash.¬† In Dec., they secured an additional 325M in liquidity (200M as a line of credit, and 125M as a 1-time gain which results in them paying a royalty on Orladeyo).¬† They have plenty of liquidity.¬†¬†
* Revenue:¬† they have 2 drugs that I consider material.¬† Orladeyo which was approved in US¬†and¬†Japan, and is about to be approved in Europe.¬† BCX9930 which is far from approval in all¬†but 1 disease in the US.¬†¬†  

   * Orladeyo is the only oral treatment for a¬†rare disease known as HAE.¬†¬†
   * Orladeyo will likely be sold for around 300000 per patient per year.¬† Biocryst set a price for sales in US of 485000, and will likely be sold for less in Europe, but I figure it averages 300000.¬† This price might sound obscene but is actually cheaper then its competition¬†Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda, which cost over 500000 per year.¬†¬†
   * Orladeyo was actually only 30-44% effective in reducing HAE attacks,¬†whereas Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda are both around 80% effective.¬† However, Orladeyo is the only oral medication while Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda both require injections.¬† The keys to Orledeyo are that it is a much more convenient and less invasive treatment, and despite its seemingly low effectiveness, it turns out that 50% of patients¬†had a 70% reduction in attacks (while the other 50% probably saw little or no benefit, averaging to 30-44%).¬†¬†
   * Also, in Biocryst's 3rd quarter conference call, management discussed a¬†survey that they¬†conducted, and found that about half of patients receiving injection treatments would consider switching to Orladeyo.¬† Since Orladeyo is effective in half of patients, and half of patients would consider switching, I conclude that Orladeyo could likely secure roughly a 25% market share
   * There are 7500 patients in US¬†and 6500 in Europe.¬† If I conservatively assume 20% market share, their revenue would be .2\*14000\*300000=840M.¬† FYI, their guidance is ""north of 500M"".¬†¬†
   * For sales in Japan, Biocryst made a deal with a pharma company called Torii.¬† Torii will sell Orladeyo in Japan and pay a royalty to Biocryst of between 20-40%, which will amount to around 15M in royalty revenue for Biocryst.¬†¬†
* Costs  

   * After looking at various income statements, it looks like cost-of-goods-sold is generally 15-33% in the pharma¬†industry.¬† I'll conservatively assume 33% for Orladeyo.¬† Gross profit is 840M\*.67 + 15M royalties=575M
   * In the [4th quarter](https://ir.biocryst.com/node/22286/pdf) they¬†had 605000 in product sales (100000 was Orladeyo).¬† COGS was¬†only¬†33000.¬† It's unclear how much of this COGS is attributable to Orladeyo or how much noise there is due to revenue still being so small, but 33000/605000 implies a COGS of just 5.5%.¬† This leads me to think my 33% assumption may be high.¬† If COGS turns out to be 25%, then gross profit would be 645M.¬†¬† If COGS turns out to be 16%, then gross profit would be 715M.¬† I can't imagine COGS being any lower (otherwise the drug wouldn't cost 485000).¬†¬†
   * As a result of securing additional liquidity, Biocryst will¬†pay a¬†royalty of 8.75% on the first 350M of sales, then 2.75% on sales between 350M and 550M, then 0 thereafter.¬† This¬†amounts¬†to a¬†maximum annual royalty expense of 350\*8.75%¬†+ 200\*2.75% = 36M
   * SG&A + R&D + interest expenses were 50M in 3rd quarter, and increased to 62M in the 4th quarter.¬† They said they had infrastructure set up to market/distribute Orladeyo¬†so I imagine SG&A won't increase much, but R&D will likely increase to fund further research of¬†BCX9930 as well as other drugs.¬† I'll assume these expenses rise to 75M per quarter, or 300M annually.¬†¬†
* Based on these assumptions that leaves profit of 575M - 36M - 300M = 239M.¬† Again, COGS is a major unknown in my model, but profit could be as large as 309M (in my 25% scenario) or 379M (in my 16% scenario)
* Share count was 176M in 3rd quarter, and increased from 110M last year.¬† I'll assume risk of further dilution to 200M.¬†¬†
* EPS is 239/200=1.19.¬† I estimate a $19 share price based on P/E of 16 and COGS of 33% (This improves to $24 and $30 share¬†prices in my 25% or 16% COGS scenarios respectively, both of which are more realistic than a conservative 33%).¬†¬†**This is** ***before*** **considering the BC.0X9930 drug, which actually seems to be their primary asset.**¬† I did not see any revenue estimates for BCX9930.¬†¬†But lets look at what we do know:  

   * 9930 is already close to approval to treat PNH in the US (here is some great [DD thats focused more on this new drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from [u/BIO9999](https://www.reddit.com/user/BIO9999/)), but there would only be around 300 patients in the US.¬† I found a presentation on Biocryst's [IR page](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) that listed other diseases that 9930 could treat, and I googled the prevalence of each in the US:¬†  

      * aHUS - 600
      * ANCA vasculitis - 6000
      * Lupus nephritis - 12000
      * IgAN vasculitis - 66000
      * glomerulonephritis - inconclusive
      * primary membranous nephropathy - 3000
      * IgA nephropathy - 7500
   * It's unclear how many of these patients would need treatment with 9930 or what the price of 9930 would be, but there seems to be a **huge opportunity for 9930 to easily double my revenue/profit¬†forecasts**.¬† This revenue is many years and many clinical trials away though,¬†and may eventually face competition from other¬†drugs, so I didn't include it in my analysis.¬†¬†
* Risks:¬† (1) I did not consider corporate tax on their profit (though they probably won't pay much tax due to years of losses to carry forward).¬† (2) I've seen politicians¬†tweet about obscene drug prices, and the bad press/political pressure may cause price reductions and instantly hurt the share price.¬† (3) According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus revenue estimates are only 56.8M in 2021 and 144M in 2022 (as opposed to my long-term estimate of 855M).¬† It seems it might be some time before they reach my revenue targets.¬†¬†
* Again, I'm not that familiar with the pharma industry so I'm not really sure what will happen with COGS, R&D, or SG&A, but I tried to be conservative.¬† I never thought I would consider a pharma stock, but this really looks good around 10.¬† Thoughts?¬†¬†

175,"PSXP, the hidden strangle bet.",25,mg0mxf,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg0mxf/psxp_the_hidden_strangle_bet/,20,"One day I was looking for long term value stocks, doing some basic screening, high dividends and low P/E ratios. Simple.

I came across PSXP, which has a extremely high distribution of roughly 12%. I looked deeply into the fundamentals of this company, finding it great. Extremely undervalued. They have strong relations with their General Partner (Phillips 66), and no sign of that ending anytime soon. They are a cash machine, with a safe distribution. There is no reason that it shouldn't have risen to about $55, where it was Pre-Covid. It is currently at $30. The units are really cheap. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

That's when I realized about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which unfortunately, they own about 25%. They are overleveraged about this, representing about 13% of their adjusted EBITDA. The problem with this is that the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) is currently under disputation whether it should be shut down, with most people agreeing that they will shut it down. DAPL took out 2.5 billion in debt, and PSXP will be forced to take their fair share of that debt. The lowering in cash flow, more debt, and potential fees for operating the pipeline without an easement, would most likely bring in a cut to the distribution, and the stock will lose value.

Doing more research, I found the pipeline is currently still operating. There is a court date April 9th, which will determine whether the operator, Energy Transfer, can keep it operating. If it is forced to close, PSXP will probably reach to the low $20s. Naturally this seems like puts are the way to go.

However, there is still a chance that they could keep it open, and the Environment Impact Statement still has a year until finished, so the opportunity for them to keep it operating for even a year is huge. This would probably carry the stock higher, especially without the worry of an dividend cut. The price would most likely exceed $38, potentially as high as $50.

I used to own, but I'm selling for a small gain. The natural bet would be options, in a strangle like pattern. The opportunity is too good to not play. The options are also really cheap, allowing huge upside. For me, I like APR 16 options and MAY 21. $35 and $25 calls/puts is what I will be doing personally. I already have various positions. I also have been trying to get $40 APR 16 calls for $1 per contract. The upside is huge and the return on investment could be easily 100 times on those.

[My current positions in PSXP](https://preview.redd.it/zaytype2h1q61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de4fb49bcec6ae5e6a49404802f85b643ceaf7)

This option profit calculator contains my current positions and my hopes. I feel like this is a bet that something will happen, which feels like almost a guarantee. However, if they push the court date back, or its a wash, I will probably have a hard time selling the contracts. But I feel like its bound to move.

177,Canadian LPs WILL be allowed in the US markets *WHEN* MSOs are allowed to uplist. $APHA/TLRY üöÄüöÄüöÄ,55,mfuvgh,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfuvgh/canadian_lps_will_be_allowed_in_the_us_markets/,39,"I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. ü§∑

**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**

Huge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**

**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS‚Äôs proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company‚Äôs technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS‚Äôs upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play ‚Äì buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn‚Äôt have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company‚Äôs potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I‚Äôll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner‚Äôs product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages

$AMRS‚Äôs consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS‚Äôs progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS‚Äôs tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

[Source: FactSet](https://preview.redd.it/zaj7ak6l6up61.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee15407674b13c2d45207fde230d9654f18f54ff)

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more

**Who is $VIAC?**

ViacomCBS Inc. is a global media and entertainment company. It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market.

**Why the selloff?**

This is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock.

Why the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble.

""Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos‚Äôs New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn‚Äôt returned."" -Someones in the shit in my opinion..

**Fundamentals**

Their total revenue has declined the last two years from 2019 27.8B to 2020 25.2B, but shall spike up again to 27.79B this year. In comparisons to another media giant $DISCA which is trading at 41.9 right now, but only has a revenue estimate of 11.87B this year and didn't look too good in its past years of 2020 with 10.6B and 2019 with 11.1B. Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2.

I also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. 

**TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued. As some hedgie is in the shit we are offered a delicious stock on a silver platter.**

195,Alexion ($ALXN): Opportunity to buy AstraZeneca ($AZN) at a discount (quick & dirty DD),39,mfouy7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfouy7/alexion_alxn_opportunity_to_buy_astrazeneca_azn/,9,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals ($ALXN) is being acquired by AstraZeneca ($AZN). The cash and stock deal was announced on December 12th, 2020 

(see AZN's release: [https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html)).

Here are the most important sections, about the price paid to ALXN shareholders and about the closing:

 *""****Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares*** *(ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.""*

*"" Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition,* ***the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.*** *""*

&#x200B;

Based on recent changes in relative prices, those who may be interested in buying AZN shares could acquire them at a discount via ALXN. 

Today's pre-market prices: AZN ADR $50,63 / ALXN $154,88

If the deal goes through (which is not a certainty at this stage; although I am no expert in regulatory aspects it seems unlikely to me that the deal might be blocked), the offer of AZN would value ALXN at $167.55/share ($60 + 2.1243 x $50.63), which is $12.67 (or 8.2%) above ALXN's current price. 

So, if you consider buying AZN, you may opt for the ALXN route which would give you a better entry price and some downside protection (discount + cash component of the offer). 

&#x200B;

Of course, this is also an opportunity for arbitrageurs (Buy ALXN, short AZN) for those who are into that kind of strategies. The exchange ratio would require to be rounded (e.g., at 2.124x, you could trade multiples of 250; at 2.125x multiples of 8). Do not forget to include transaction costs and borrow rates in the equation.

196,TIGR Undervalued and crushing performance both at home and internationally.,84,mfl88p,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfl88p/tigr_undervalued_and_crushing_performance_both_at/,42,"Currently sat at $14.47 I believe $TIGR is one of the most undervalued stonks around and is only being held down due to uncertainty in Chinese companies.

The earnings report recently contributed the following information. 

Operating and financial metrics saw a huge boost due to retention and expansion of clients. Total revenue increased by 2.4 x to 47.2m

Non-GAAP net income was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter, nearly 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter last year. 

Tigr added 44,000 new funded accounts this quarter nearly quadruple the number from the same period last year. 

Total funded accounts reached 259,000 by the end of 2020 more than double that of 2019. Growth in client assets was outstanding.

Total account balance reached $16 billion more than triple that of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 46.2% higher than the third quarter of 2020. 

Overall, for 2020, total revenue was $138 million more than double versus 2019. 

TIGR were profitable for the first time on a yearly basis.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $22.3 million in 2020, a big improvement from a non-GAAP loss of $1.8 million in 2019.

International clients represented 40% of newly funded accounts. TIGR expect that in 2021 to add more than 350,000 funded accounts. International clients will comprise more than 50% of the new funded accounts. 

The growth and adoption of TIGR's ESOP system accelerated as they added 35 clients in the fourth quarter for a cumulative total of 124 clients. 

It is expected their ESOP system will maintain its leading position and foresee further increases in market share

In July of 2019 TIGR  acquired Marsco, a U.S. broker dealer with over 30 years of self clearing experience. They also acquired their clearing licenses. 

The investment to transition to self-clearing remains a key milestone in the firm's development.

They now have the technological and operational prowess to control every aspect of the brokerage system from the front end to the back end.

The percentage of clients having their U.S. cash equities trades, self-cleared by Marsco, continued to increase and at the end of the fourth quarter reached over 20%.

In addition, Marsco is conducting clearing for all new clients on-boarding in the U.S. 

In February 2021, TIGR in total issued $65 million of convertible bonds. 

This capital will accelerate  international expansion, as well as support further investments in  research and development 

Total revenues were $47.2 million this quarter, increased 137% from the same quarter of last year. The increase was due to bigger user base 

Within the total revenue, commission increased 245% from last year to reach $25.2 million. Interest-related income, which combines financial service fee and interest income, was $13.3 million, an increase of 53% from last year.

Other revenue, mostly revenue from investment banking business, increased 118% from last year to $8.7 million.

Interest expense increased to $4.3 million from $1.5 million last year as we have more consolidated account customers. Net revenue after interest expense was $43 million, an increase of 135% from the same quarter last year. 

Non-GAAP net income, which excludes share-based compensation, was $10.3 million this quarter, 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter of last year.¬†

TLDR: TIGR crushed earnings crushed growth looks set to do it again next year and is seriously undervalued and even took a lovely dip down to 14.50 last week based on uncertainty in the market over Chinese companies listed on the NYSE.

I believe his company today should be worth between 22-24 and could easily grow to the 50's based on its international potential and expected future growth

This ship the Ever Given is the 4th largest dildo man kind has ever created.  This dildo is now in your asshole. You‚Äôve been eating lots of tendies recently and you need to take an epic shit.  If you don‚Äôt do something about this Empire State Building size dildo in your ass you might have problems.

https://istheshipstillstuck.com

Never mind it‚Äôs free!!! Go to edits unless you want some funny 

1. The media story of a gust of wind is a factor but something f'd up big. 

2. Ship was going 13 knots, when usually ships go around 8 knots. Whatever happened, happened quick and hard.

3. Look at the red paint at the bottom of the ship at the bow- that should be underwater. Just think about how much weight just was raised by about a one story house. There are 20,000 of those big containers on the ship. 

4. Let‚Äôs talk about tides, for the apes who live in trees.  This planet we live on has ‚Äútides‚Äù, because it spins commonly called day and night. Tides are caused by the moon. The moon is one out of two really big things we see in the sky. It‚Äôs also where rocket ships live. 

Everyday the tide goes up and down, twice to be exact. but if you look day to day, high tides get higher, then peak, then come back down again, just like your bank account. The peak happens on March 31 and again two weeks later.  This peak is also special( but not like you), it‚Äôs called a spring tide. The water level will be the highest it will be until April 25th. The 31st is the best chance of getting her off. (That‚Äôs what she said)

https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest

5. Potential for an even bigger fuck up is not unthinkable.  To build these huge ships they make them just able the handle rough seas. Since the ship is aground front and back though they are going to need to pull one or both ends out kinda sideways. It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.  

So, you‚Äôve eaten at Taco Bell, you understand.  This is a problem, you are starting to sweat, but it‚Äôs not a disaster yet. How do we fix this ass problem: Dig her out, pull her out, or float her.

I think we‚Äôve all seen that poor crane, one bulldozer and 4 dudes trying their best, but something tells me this might not be the answer.  It can help, and what I hope happens is that dredging can help, but I know nothing on the topic.

Some basic maths: let‚Äôs say one third of the ship is aground. The Least Fucks Ever Given weighs about 200,000 metric tons.  This is a friction problem.  You need 50% of the weight that is aground to pull her off, that‚Äôs around 30,000 tons of force. Another ship, the Far Samson, is the most powerful tug boat in the world and can pull 420(woot woot) tons.   You would need more than 15 of these but there is only one. 

Siapem 3000 to the rescue?  Another way to fix this is to make the ship lighter, they are already doing this, ballast is being removed and fuel is being taken out, but the best way to make her float is to take off the containers.  This is not easy to do, because the ship is so tall. There are only a few crane ships that can off load containers 40 meters up.  One of these the Saipem 3000 is in the Red Sea and in transit. Shout out: u/parsimonyBase

So Saipem 3000, I hope you get the Ever Given so high that you literally save the global economy. 

Cheers to all of those working the problem! Thanks to all the merchant sailors out there, you are our only hope!

P.S. hope you are having a good day!

Edit: so the DD play here is, if it‚Äôs not out by the 31st buy gold and oil, and short everything, because if its there for a few weeks, it‚Äôs going to be real bad for global trade. Chip shortage, you can‚Äôt get a 2021 car right now, metals, vaccines, ppe, etc.  anything that goes between Asia and the EU.  The US won‚Äôt feel it at first bc not a lot of our trade goes through Suez but we‚Äôll feel the hit eventually.

Edit 2: if you look at my name I usually go by Nat. One of you kind folks brought to my attention NAT. They ship oil. Are the stars aligning?

Edit 3: THEY MOVED IT 30 YARDS! YAY! Just to be clear I‚Äôm kinda rooting for the ‚Äúthey get it out‚Äù and we all don‚Äôt have a global crisis scenario. So DD might not apply.

Edit 4: Just as I‚Äôm going to sleep, I hear that Ever Given has been refloated! The dildo isn‚Äôt out yet, but we‚Äôre good and lubed.  Fuck that Taco Bell we‚Äôre going to have some fun! Tomorrow might be messy but I‚Äôm taking this as a good sign. May the tendies flow. Have a good night!

Edit 5: Well if you are still here, thanks, The story so far is this. I(the world) went to sleep last night with a mammoth dildo In my ass.  As I wake up, I find some mysterious hero has jiggled it out as I was sleep.   Whoever you are I want to thank you!

Edit 6: if you know anyone who helped or know how to get in touch with one m, please send this song to them from me! [Whoever You Are, Geggy Tah](https://luakabop.bandcamp.com/track/whoever-you-are) It‚Äôs an early 2000‚Äôs song. For those of you too young to understand all this butt talk it‚Äôs a pretty cool song.

200,MRE may be an absolute bargain stock,144,mfi5s2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfi5s2/mre_may_be_an_absolute_bargain_stock/,42,"Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the information presented is accurate. I am not a professional or financial advisor of any form.

Martinrea International is a stock that designs, develops and manufactures automotive parts. With the pandemic unwinding, demand for vehicles is likely to go up in the future, and this could spur demand for automotive manufacturing. This is on top of the fact the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels.

The stock is a major bargain at the moment, trading at just $12.54CAD, while analysts give price targets of $17.00, an average of $18.94 and a high of $22.00. If any of the analysts currently looking at the stock are correct, the stock is poised for a gain of 35-76%. The stock recently suffered a poor Q4 result, which was followed by quite a large dip. They suffered a 12% decrease in profit even though their sales grew. However, it was noted that if you take adjusted profit that excludes most one time items, profits actually grew by 31%. Effectively the market may be underestimating the value of MRE.

In terms of statistics, the stock has a P/S ratio of 0.3 and a P/B ratio of 0.86. MRE is currently trading even below its book value. This compares favourably to competitors like Magna International, which has a P/S of 1.01 and a P/B of 2.89 or Linamar which has a P/S of 0.83 and a P/B of 1.12.

From a technical perspective, the stock is quite solid. The daily price has just formed a tweezer bottom pattern, suggesting the stock is likely to move upwards. Moreover, the stock is sitting right above a major trendline that has been touched 4-6 times in the past. Thus it could be predicted that the stock will bounce off this trendline once again. Third, the most recent peak sits at a price level of around $12.20, so if the other support levels were to fail, this would likely pose another support level for the stock. Finally, the 14 day RSI currently sits at 30.26. This is the lowest RSI since the start of the pandemic and could be indicative of an oversold condition. This could provide additional evidence for a reversal in trend in the near future. Each time when the stock moves from peak to trough it appears to take approximately 2-4 months. If this trend continues, this could potentially be the time horizon in which to anticipate the stock returning from a bottom to a top in the future, although this is an assumption that will not necessarily hold true.

&#x200B;

[Chart of MRE stock price. Recent peak that presents resistance is circled. RSI value that is the lowest since the pandemic start is circled in the purple pane.

A relatively safe play might be to wait for reasonable confirmation of a reversal in the stock price and to take a conservative sell target at the most recent high, which was at about 16.21. If one were to buy at the current closing price and sell at that high, this would represent a gain of about 29.3% with an expected time horizon of approximately 2-4 months. However, it is possible the stock will exceed that level based on analyst estimates.

TLDR; MRE appears to be an undervalued stock ripe for a reversal in the future. Potential gains may exceed 30% based on analyst estimates and technical analysis. The anticipated time horizon for the trade is approximately 2-4 months based on previous movements in the stock's price.

So, quick backstory, Tiger Asia Management had to sell 30B of equities to meet a margin call. As a result, Discovery, Farfetch, a bunch of Chinese stocks, etc, all fell stupid amounts on Friday. FTCH is down 6% today as well as the fallout continues, but it's not based on any fundamentals

Looking at Tipranks, FTCH has an average analyst price target of 67 dollars. It's not a Chinese stock and it's not media, but it does have exposure to the global remergence following Coronavirus recovery. I think it's a great play and makes a lot of sense. It's currently trading at 48 dollars now. It used to be 73 dollars.

TL:DR FTCH is underpriced following a major blow up in asset management",3/29/21 23:09
203,Let‚Äôs Talk About ‚ÄúMarket Makers‚Äù,584,mf8qv7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf8qv7/lets_talk_about_market_makers/,71," 

Let‚Äôs Talk About ‚ÄúMarket Makers‚Äù

Getting Straight to the point.

There are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a ‚ÄúMarket Maker‚Äù.

However each license does not make you a market maker.

There are three different types of license holders:

\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),

\-Floor brokers

\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)

1.) The DMMs, formerly known as ‚Äúspecialists,‚Äù act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.

2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.

3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE‚Äôs goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.

Example of DMM Role:

On the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.

Each of the counters is a DMM‚Äôs post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs‚Äô posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.

Important: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.

Example of DMM Role:

Your clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM‚Äôs post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM‚Äôs post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer‚Äôs representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to ‚Äúwork‚Äù the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM‚Äôs post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM‚Äôs bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 √ó 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.

For a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM‚Äôs post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the ‚Äúcrowd.‚Äù In such cases, the DMM‚Äôs responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM‚Äôs post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.",3/29/21 4:05
204,$YETI Trade Idea,15,mfr3t8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfr3t8/yeti_trade_idea/,7,"Trade: $YETI 7 MAY $67 Calls from present till 28 April

Thesis:$YETI bottomed out its Implied Volatility cycle and is running sideways on a rollercoaster. I'm 'Rooish on the stock. As implied volatility increases up to the peak of the cycle it will drive up the Extrinsic Value of the Calls. Meanwhile the Intrinsic Value of the calls will increase during the upswings of the rollercoaster

There is an opportunity to maximize profit by converging these two forces, selling on the upswing of intrinsic and extrinsic value which should occur roughly around 28 April.

Price target on 7 May (Strike): $70 but it doesnt matter

How did I arrive at this number? I drew lines on a chart with my fingers and guesstimated. So its fake and means nothing. It‚Äôs also the average price of the rollercoaster IMO, I think the coaster is shrinking but should at least average to $70.

Price target on 28 April (profit day): $67.27-73.86

Am I allowed to offer a range as a price target? I don‚Äôt know.

The $67.27 is where I believe the implied volatility cycle peaks and intersects with the bottoming out of the rollercoaster, which is the worst case outcome, low intrinsic as extrinsic maxes, but you take a profit mostly of the extrinsic and a very small gain in intrinsic.

The $73.86 is the peak of the coaster around the implied volatility and peak. intrinsic to the tits. extrinsic pretty damn high.

Why do I think it plays out this way? The Greeks and The Underlying -

Greeks: Delta 0.7 Theta (0.0544) Vega 0.0841 - I fully believe the implied volatility will increase from about .53 to .8 driving the extrinsic up by about $2 over the next 30 days, hedging the $1.63 theta decay.

Breakeven on implied volatility gains against the theta decay is an increase of implied volatility by .19 to .72. Also, I‚Äôm anticipating exiting the position early negating the last bit of Theta Decay. Basically, sell on the upswing closest to 28 APR.

The Underlying:

Earnings: projected earnings to occur 6 May, meaning I expect the implied volatility cycle to increase to peak or near-peak by 28 April, just a bit before earnings

Earnings outlook: $YETI is strapped with cash and just expanded further in the consumer space to bags. Anecdotally I feel its the case that YETI has an unusually high attach rate for the space its in. I think people will think YETI is reporting favorable earnings, driving the price up on its way to earnings.

206,Blackberry QNX + IVY might be the next Android + Google Mobile Services,993,mf2t5a,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf2t5a/blackberry_qnx_ivy_might_be_the_next_android/,154,"Blackberry as a third-party software provider has the best shot at building an industry-standard vehicle software platform because they do not compete directly with the automakers. 

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform.",3/28/21 23:19

**God Damnit there is so much to talk about today** that it‚Äôs hard to know where to begin. Earnings are tommorow 3/29 after market.  I think the usual disclaimer is that this is not financial advice and that you should make your own decisions like a big boy and girl is great place to start.

***Takes a hit of Copium***

**Price is not an indicator of value.** ^((said in the kind of voice that keeps the smoke in.))

Useful is to...***cough*** perhaps recap... ***cough cough***  the last week of price action as being something that was difficult to swallow as shares of GOEV began to approximate the cost of admission to your mom‚Äôs discount crotch circus but thank god we didn‚Äôt get that low. (By the way the quality of that spectacle really went down during her ""Groupon Phase"".)  The only consolation is that [GOEV accrued the most significant amount of short interest](https://u.teknik.io/KgmjB.png) in a small amount of time that I have ever seen.  If you can stomach the price drop and GOEV does return to the ring we are in a much better tactical position than we ever have been.

**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.

**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**

Micro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered [4 miles away.](https://u.teknik.io/JITxs.PNG)  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other‚Äôs FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall‚Ä¶ I mean football game.

So we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet‚Äôs views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool

But suddenly cn0110 busts in and says ‚ÄúHave you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!‚Äù.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.

This continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta boots down the door with a loop stick in one hand, weighted blanket in the other and proceeds to tard wrangle everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of ‚ÄúVehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time‚Äù and ‚ÄúTheir electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo‚Äôs‚Äù.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said ‚ÄúGod dammit not again‚Äù.

**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a ‚ÄúSedan‚Äù like Canoo car this smells kind of like a ‚Äúnon-compete clause‚Äù.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.

Moreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause ‚Äú""*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.""  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.

**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**

**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**

**TLDR** \- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech to produce customizable Top Hats provided by Divergent 3D whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**

**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**

**P.S** \- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.

**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.

**Edit 1** \- Canoo Has Bantz! they just dropped a video of the truck driving on their Instagram and called it ""Coming in hot"",  Ride Bros where the flames Ride Bros? where's the flames?

213,Why Cannabis Legalization is BEARISH for some MSOs and BULLISH AF for LPs like $APHA/$TLRY üöÄüöÄüöÄ,247,mf3mog,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3mog/why_cannabis_legalization_is_bearish_for_some/,154,"This weekend New York legislators finally agreed on all details of their marijuana legalization bill, and expect it to be voted on in the coming days. It is GREAT news for LPs, and pretty worrying for retail dependant MSOs like Trulieve, but great news for wholesale based MSOs like Cresco or 4 Front. 

[Article about NY weed from our favorite shills, CNBC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1262266) 

The interesting part of NY's bill is that they are implementing a TIERED system. Meaning MSOs will **NOT** be allowed to create an oligarchy like they are accustomed to and rely upon. Some companies will be grandfathered in, but even those grandfathered will come with some pretty shitty limitations on expansion. LPs entering the market later will be in a better position than grandfathered MSOs, by multiples. 

It is also interesting that New York believes that their model will be the ideal national model. That would have some massive consequences for MSOs. 

>""When this bill becomes law, New York will be poised to implement a nation-leading model for what marijuana legalization can look like.""

Considering Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is crafting his own federal marijuana bill for the Senate, there's every reason to believe we will see similarities between New York's bill and Schumer's bill. The intent here is clear, Democrats want to use the marijuana industry to create opportunities for minorities, and oligarchies do not create opportunities. MSOs are watching their precious business model crumble right before their eyes, and LPs are watching a marvelous industry open slowly with WIDE OPEN arms. A forced vertical integration is worst case scenario for LPs, but being allowed to ship their products into states like NY without having to own a retail store to do so, is the **best** case scenario. No retail commitments and very little infrastructure is the exact ""capital light model"" Curaleaf is using to tackle the EU market, and it's the same one ALL LPs will be using to enter the US. Curaleaf specifically says that their EU approach has ""tremendous financial benefits"" versus the US approach of vertical integration. 

Keep in mind companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf wouldn't be ""big"" without having the advantage of establishing oligarchies. Trulieve for example holds over 50% market share in Florida thanks to the overly restricted laws surrounding marijuana. There's absolutely no chance they will be able to hold a 50% market share in a open legal market. There's also no reason to expect they will even be successful at all once *any* competition is allowed in. They will be fighting at least 10x the amount of stores they currently compete with. They will be forced to compete via price and quality, for the first time. They are untested in both aspects. Anyone can sell weed when you're the only guy in town selling it, just ask a cartel how they sell brick weed. Lol. Your product quality doesn't matter if there's little to no competition. Also, it's not like either company has a ""secret sauce"" that makes them successful. They don't have brand loyalty like ""Cookies,"" and they haven't been proven in a competitive market like 4Front. They just sell weed in places where there's not much competition, that's it. 

Most MSO gang morons, I mean Investors, are stuck looking at the marijuana industry as it stands today. Last I checked, Investing is a **forward** looking thing. Today's marijuana Industry creates oligarchies, tomorrow's marijuana Industry creates opportunities. Companies, like Cresco or 4Front, who are wholesale focused are in the best position to take advantage of the thousands and thousands of new shelves that will opening with federal legalization. Companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf will have to reinvent their business model, and Trulieve might actually have to pay someone to create some logo artwork for them. 

Their current logo looks like a $5 package from Fiverr. Maybe upgrade to the $20 this time, Trulieve. Lmao.",3/29/21 0:00
214,Battle of the Fallen Giants: ViacomCBS vs DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC. (A shallow comparison of them both.),211,mf30uw,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf30uw/battle_of_the_fallen_giants_viacomcbs_vs/,88,"BLUF: Both of these stocks are knee deep in the streaming wars. They both fell sharply last week due to a hedge fund liquidation. Read more about that in the link below. Over the past 5 days, DISCA fell 46%, and VIAC fell 51%. Both have a bullish sentiment, along with their pros and cons.

>[ViacomCBS, Discovery plunge due in part to forced liquidation of Archegos Capital positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html)

Below is a 3 month snapshot of both stocks, along with SPY just for comparison purposes.

[3 Month view of VIAC, DISCA, and SPY](https://preview.redd.it/8qhzft9xesp61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e655fb4a233038e41f0122327e3f763f9a3601)

Both VIAC and DISCA followed each other rather closely in terms of percentage gained. Even with the recent drop, had the stock been held, both would come out beating the market.

**Profile Overview:**

[VIAC is approx. 18&#37; larger than DISCA.](https://preview.redd.it/u0xhj70yesp61.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5124890c20f75a651950f10fd820578eb93f8c50)

**Brands:**

[VIAC Brands](https://preview.redd.it/u38uz250fsp61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a68fe0ef84f167f1b5669b05ff34154bab14a61)

**Profitability:**

https://preview.redd.it/dmmkpgy3fsp61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a735ab5a2608ec4ba38c11429c06cd2d3e8cb47

DISCA comes out ahead here. They both have a rather decent profit margin, but DISCA has a whopping 24% advantage over VIAC.

**Momentum:**

https://preview.redd.it/lm5e6jq4fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e245da1875ed75731ddc6fed5d8a64aae9a3b25

Let's skip over the 1 month price performance, as this has been explained via the first link provided at the top.

DISCA comes out ahead in the less than 6 months, and the greater than 1 year price performance. Meanwhile, VIAC is the clear winner in the 9 month to 1 year price performance. Overall, both performed well recently, but DISCA has been consistently in the green.

**Income Statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/638r7ng5fsp61.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67ae40ae70845b7ba971bdc1c6699017eb8684d

VIAC's revenue is the clear winner here. They pull in more than double DISCA's revenue. They also come out ahead in every other faucet.

**Balance Sheet:**

https://preview.redd.it/t17gusa6fsp61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86a682e7a11bf08a3500f886aec5a323cc8c36b

Now, their balance sheets. Both have a nice chunk of cash on hand, which should give investors confidence. VIAC does hold more debt, however, they also recently announced that they are going to issue more shares, which should give them a boost of approx. $3B. DISCA, as of writing this and to my knowledge, has not released any statement concerning the issuance of more shares.

**Short Interest:**

[VIAC Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/2sdrhb27fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8eac76c2537f90575b9a6719148d29550f919)

[VIAC Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/) \- VIAC, as of 15 March, has 18.9%, a decrease of .5% since February 26th.

[DISCA Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/) \- DISCA, as of 15 March, has 29.7%, an increase of .6% since February 26th.

Overall, both of these companies have provided growth to their investors, even after the drastically sharp decline. With the recent decline of the NASDAQ over the past month, it's a bit of a toss-up on which one will be better in the long-term (imo that is.)

**Positions:** NONE in either of these companies. However, I am looking to buy into one of these two, after the market opens tomorrow.

EDIT:  Dividend (See Image Below) VIAC has a dividend, DISCA does not.

215,Hertz could become the next GME because of all the Melvins shorting it,0,mgij08,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgij08/hertz_could_become_the_next_gme_because_of_all/,53,"Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.

Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.

# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short

Anybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)

13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.

https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a

A lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.

# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand

For most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6db

Gamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.

Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:

1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.
2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.

So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.

# This is not an investment

The stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you.",3/30/21 23:26
216,$Root why I like this stock.,136,mf5c1e,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf5c1e/root_why_i_like_this_stock/,128,"$Root is a disruptive fintech in the insurance world. 

Traditional insurance uses different correlations to gauge riskiness of customers to determine pricing, with credit score being the biggest determinant but also gender, age, and make/model of the car.

$Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers. Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user's driving behavior. Every 9 months the data collected allows $Root to reiterate their pricing models. Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions.

To highlight the effectiveness of using telematics in seasoned states with just one 9 month iteration of collecting data $ROOT was able to deliver a 15% improvement in their loss ratio. That is a substantial cost savings that will grow even further overtime with each reiteration. 

Thier IPO last year during a pandemic had some of the biggest tech names including snowflake investor Dragoneer at an IPO price of $27. 

During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37%. Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics. Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models. Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models. $Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies.

Bear Arguments.
Insurance is a nongrowth mature industry with big players to compete against. 
Covid-19- less people driving and nobody knows how driving behavior will be in the future with wfh.
Shorts are also not understanding the potential tech with telematics and how it could revolutionize insurance with fairer pricing and lead to SaaS to those who use driving info.
Root is a startup and is burning cash. Like most startups profitability will be an undeterminatable time away. Growth in written premiums is 37% over last year with a 17% reduction in loss ratio.

Short Squeeze Potential
Currently a lot of the shares outstanding are locked up until 4/26. 13 million float. 68-74% short interest.

Gamma Squeeze Potential.
Call Volume was over 40,000 on Friday for 4/16

Catalyst for short squeeze and potential price targets.
There is a lot of DD on here. If you type Root in the search bar and DD multiple posts come up in the past two months. Citron Research posted on Twitter Friday the potential for a short squeeze. Volume on Friday with citron posts was 3.5x the average.. This is really a wsb thing and looking at the DD on here it might be possible citron stole the idea from here. 

The insurance industry although mature is huge and Root could offer SaaS in the future to major insurance carriers. Most of the shorts probably entered at the 22 mark, the gamma ramp goes up to 40, I could see this from a short squeeze with the low float and the twitter pump going to 60+ by 4/16.

Positions: 2,000 shares 10 10c 4/16 10 7.5c 4/16 adding more tomorrow thinking 20c. 

Further readings: there's tons of DD on here if you look in the search bar. Also if you look up citron research on Twitter. Idk I think he stole the idea from us. Tendies should be ours.",3/29/21 1:22
217,QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated),152,mf3r7c,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3r7c/qnx_hypervisor_will_be_in_all_future_connected/,25,"Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as ""smartphones on wheels"", they see them as ""data centers on wheels"".

Blackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). 

The other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. 

In other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. 

QNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements which are essential for instrument clusters and vehicle control. Nobody wants to see their speedometer or brakes lagging behind or their digital dashboard crashing in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. 

AGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.

On the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video. Blackberry has a great track record in security and its security expertise is world leading, so this is another stickiness of QNX.",3/29/21 0:06
