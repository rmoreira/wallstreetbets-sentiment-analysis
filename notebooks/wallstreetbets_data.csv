We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Technical Analysis doesn't mean too much to GME, but it certainly tells us something. I think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the Earnings Report coming later today. Here are some a few key indicators why GME can and will go up dramatically soon.

&#x200B;

[1 Hour Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/007anng09to61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff7be90f38ab719c4288d31a1ff33f04b32cd8f)

&#x200B;

1. **RSI -** The first point I'd like to touch on is RSI. As you can see, the RSI is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when GME was making it's comeback from the drop to $40. Now look at the RSI **AT THE SAME PRICE** today and you'll see that we are heading towards being oversold. What does this mean? It's simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase.

2. **Trend -** In terms of the month, we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks. From the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend. Now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area, it's starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area. The current trend we are in is a Bullish Descending Triangle, much like the Pennant we saw earlier.

3. **Volume -** With GME, when volume goes up, price goes up. If you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up, the price tends to skyrocket. Right now volume is extremely low, a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further.

4. **Turning Point -** With the RSI, Trend, and Volume all pointing towards future rapid growth, I'm inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon. I do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point, and the only way I see it getting to that area is MASSIVE short selling to artificially drop the price.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** The technicals point toward GME skyrocketing in the near future. Take this all with a grain of salt though, the price could very well drop below the areas I've mentioned before going up. Above all else **HODL** and the tendies shall come!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE - 3/23/2021 - 6:58 ET:** Looks like the price was driven down after a relatively good earnings report, can't say it was totally unexpected but it certainly threw many of us off. The price was starting to break upwards only to be violently thrown downwards. iborrowdesk shows that 50k shares were borrowed and likely contributed to this selling pressure. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

The price did bounce off of $150 like previously mentioned after getting down to around 15-20 RSI. They're now in a very oversold territory, but it wouldn't surprise me if they kept trying to artificially lower the price. The shorts aren't going to give up so easily. So **HOOOOODLLLLL** fellow apes.

However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*

&#x200B;

So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.

Fear.

Slowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!

&#x200B;

*""What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?""*

This guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.

&#x200B;

*""Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?""*

Great question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.

So, without further ado, let us begin.

\-----

# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival

Chapter 1

Protecting it from everyone else

&#x200B;

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, “look at Moneybags over here”, “must be nice”, or “remember the little guy”, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You’ll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)

On top of that, they’re gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.

They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

By that point, you’ve lost. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, “no”. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

There's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can’t take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.

*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Protecting it from expenses

&#x200B;

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Protecting it from yourself

&#x200B;

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

\-----

# Part 2 - Economic Survival

Chapter 1

Taxes

&#x200B;

Roughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""*ouch*"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!

With that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Debt

&#x200B;

If you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.

Now, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

FIRE

&#x200B;

FIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.

Now, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.

This would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:

* **Lean FIRE** \- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year
* **Fat FIRE** \- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)
* **Barista FIRE** \- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.
* **Coast FIRE** \- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Investments

&#x200B;

Before I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...

I believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*

**Stock Market** \- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.

**Real Estate** \- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.

**Businesses** \- ""Small business is the backbone of our economy."" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.

# Part 3 - What Comes Next?

Chapter 1

Spending

&#x200B;

Alright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Building a cabinet

&#x200B;

Now, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Giving

&#x200B;

And now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.

&#x200B;

Chapter 4

Sources for you to perform your own Due Diligence

&#x200B;

In this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!

[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.

*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)

*Dave Ramsey Show - YouTube* *:* A religious millionaire who hosts a radio show revolving around teaching people how to get out of debt and take control of their personal finances to become (and stay) millionaires. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)

[https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/](https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/) \- A resource for a more detailed description of FIRE.

[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.

\-----

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***""The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.""***

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

𝕹𝖊𝖜𝖙𝖔𝖓'𝖘 𝕷𝖆𝖜 𝖔𝖋 𝖀𝖓𝖎𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖘𝖆𝖑 𝕲𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓 (𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓐𝓹𝓮 𝓛𝓪𝔀)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s² and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>gₑ = (6.67 \* 10⁻¹¹ N•m²/kg²)(6.0\*10²⁴ kg(/(6.4\*10⁶m)²  
>  
>gₑ = 9.8 m/s²

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually 𝕭𝖎𝖌 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇𝖘 who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GMₑ= gₑ \* Rₑ²

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""ₑ's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE²

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29²  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us. 

&#x200B;

His Law of Universal Gravitation was never about forces that would pull things down to Earth, it was about things that would rocket past the moon  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10-K filings for specific phrases. Let's see just how common this language is, shall we? First, the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety:

&#x200B;

>**The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.**  
>  
>Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  
>  
>  
>  
>**A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.**  
>  
>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.

>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P.

**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**


*This indicates four more board members than previously announced are planning on leaving. Additionally, a little further down there is a caveat under the description of the formation of the Strategic Committee that indicates additional senior executive changes may be in the cards:*


>Our Board of Directors has formed a committee of directors called the “Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee” (the Strategic Committee). The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our operational objectives and corporate strategy, capital allocation priorities and other opportunities for maximizing stockholder value. Our Board, through the Strategic Committee, is currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm to assist it in its evaluation and exploration. **This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of our senior executives.**

\*They paid $57 million in debt and still had $635m in cash.

\*They cut operating expenses by 18% in Q4, and 21% for the fiscal year.

But the real value of this stock comes from its future, not its past performance.  If they were killing it, you wouldn't get it at a discount.  You make money by being ahead of Wall Street, and right now Wall Street focuses on old measurements and mature companies.  You only hit it big if you can see what most people can't, or won't see.  Go watch DFV videos on YouTube from last July.

Ryan Cohen is a freaking genius.  Anyone that can take on Amazon and win is a really good bet in my opinion.  He invested

Hired Josh Krueger on 3/1/2021 to oversee GME's e-commerce fulfillment.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon  
Jenna Owens named as COO today.  Guess where she came from?  Amazon and before that Google and McKinsey.  
Neda Pacifico was named as Senior Vice President of E-commerce today.  Guess where she came from?  Chewy.  
Hired Matt Francis as first-ever Chief Technology Officer today.  Guess where he came from?  Amazon

I'll admit, it sucked to see the price drop after-hours below my cost.   Let's just say I have a material portion of my net worth in GME.  But ultimately, you either believe in the company or not.  I have 35 years of accounting and executive mgmt - I've studied up on this company.  Considering the success and expertise of the people driving the GME rocket, I'm all in and I'm not folding.  

The gaming industry is bigger than movies and all North American sports - COMBINED, and these are committed customers trust me.  It's like asking an addict if they plan to buy drugs this year.  Duh, they are going to buy more.

When you think about what is on the line for these hedge funds, did you really think they were just going to fold?  Those bastards only win if you quit.  Hold the stock because it's a really good investment, not because it's a short-squeeze opportunity, though that's some nice icing on the top.  Patience, nothing good ever comes easy.

Remember, the only way to beat Goliath is if a whole lot of Apes stand together.

I did company valuations before and have gotten pretty accurate estimates. While I’m doing this valuation on GME, I can tell that I like the fundamentals of GameStop. Just think about it:
1) stating the obvious but would any of these senior leadership with massive backgrounds go work in a sinking ship? Of course not. GameStop for the long run
2) the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of 11% and no one is positioned to take over that market like GameStop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry
3) e-commerce sales of GameStop accounts for 32% of all sales in just a year. This is insanely good. Reducing the brick and mortar side of business and increasing the online one is how it’s gonna be going forward. And this is all done under the supervision of e-commerce geniuses who built startups from scratch
4) when GameStop closes many of their stores that cost a lot of money per year, they’ll cut down on staffing, rents, and utilities which in turn will reduce their overall costs and increase their margins. They can even reduce margin on consoles and other accessories to the extent where it’s perfect competition with Amazon and ignite that huge used products market. 

It’s late here and I have to sleep but there’s a lot more that makes me believe this company is worth much more than chewy, zalando, and other e-commerce platforms.

37,Description of ATM Offerings for confused GME apes,147,mbsicz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbsicz/description_of_atm_offerings_for_confused_gme_apes/,29,"Per the title, I'm seeing a lot of confusion regarding what an at-the-market (""ATM"") offering entails, and what the consequences of such an offering would be. Lots of GME apes are seeing the following language (from the 10-K) and are confused/scared:

*In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an ""at the market offering"" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock.* 

Apes are worried the share price will decline, etc., so I thought I'd do a (relatively) brief post to provide some info and hopefully calm some fears. **TLDR at the bottom.**

**First, what is an ATM offering?**

In a sentence, an ATM offering is an offering where the Company issues securities over time directly into an existing trading market at the market price.

**Why do Companies conduct ATM offerings?**

For $$$. Basically, it gives companies the opportunity to raise measured amounts of equity capital over time by allowing a company to tap into the existing secondary market for its shares on an as-and-when-needed basis. 

**How are ATM offerings unique from traditional underwritten follow-on offerings?**

In contrast to traditional underwritten offerings, where a Company issues a fixed # of shares at a fixed price, all at once, in an ATM offering, the Company retains control over the timing and size of each sale.

Sales of the Company’s shares, which can be newly issued “primary” shares and/or “secondary” shares held by existing security holders, are made through one or more registered broker-dealers who act as agents on the issuer’s behalf.

**What are the advantages of an ATM offering?**

**Minimal market impact.**

This is likely the *MOST IMPORTANT* advantage for us apes

Because in an ATM offering program, the securities are sold in small batches over time, the Company can incrementally sell shares into the natural trading flow of the market, without having to market and/or announce the offering. As a result, shares are able to “trickle” into the market, limiting the impact on the issuer’s stock price. Additionally, investors cannot short the issuer’s stock in advance of the offering since the timing of any particular sale is not known.

**Flexibility.**

The timing and size of an ATM offering are at the Company’s discretion, which means the Company can match its capital structure to its ongoing needs. For example, the Company can implement a limit price below which sales will not occur and/or a percentage limitation on daily sales to reduce downward price pressure on its stock, as well as dilution.

**Low Cost.**

The distribution costs for ATM offerings typically are less than for traditional follow-on offerings, and the absence of an issuer commitment to sell means that there will be no sales below acceptable share prices.

**What are the disadvantages of an ATM offering?**

The main disadvantage is that because ATM offerings tend to be substantially smaller than traditional follow-on offerings, they aren’t as useful to companies trying to raise a large amount of capital.

This disadvantage doesn’t really impact GME nor does it impact us stockholders. In fact, we could read this as a positive in that GME isn’t trying to raise a ton of money right now because they don’t need it!

**TLDR**: Don’t freak out over the fact that GME adopted an ATM program allowing the Company to issue more shares. An ATM Offering is a much more favorable alternative to a traditional underwritten offering and in reality doesn’t impact stock prices in any significant way. If anything, the fact that GME would choose an ATM offering over any other type could mean they’re thinking about us apes ;)

**TLDR to TLDR**: HODL 💎🙌

**Disclaimer**: This is a very scaled-down overview of how ATM offerings work. Do your own research if you’d like to learn more – there are a lot of memos and articles out there with good information.  Also feel free to comment/PM me if you want to correct and/or supplement this post with more info.

However, with the latest round of orchestrated ""flash crashes"" being done on meme stocks, and Fintel actually reporting lower ""Short Volume Ratio"" afterwards, I set out to find out just what the hell is going on.

Turns out, Fintel gets their Short Volume figure from FINRA's [Daily Short Sale Volume Files](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Through that webpage, you can find short volume data for any stock for any given day. For example, today 2021-03-22, FINRA maintains that GME had a **short volume of 2,358,752** with a **total volume of 3,843,634**. And according to FINRA, Total Volume is defined as ""**share volume of all executed trades during regular trading hours**.""

&#x200B;

[FINRA Daily Short Sale Volume File Format Legend](https://preview.redd.it/l45d11be6po61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4298fe454531bedf29690f7db0bb901785a0c3)

Alright, that's cool and all but what is wrong? Well, the problem is the Total Volume figure reported by FINRA is completely off and the fact that services like Fintel uses FINRA's short volume data to calculate short volume ratio presents inaccurate data to the public.

For example, Fintel is currently reporting a **23%** Short Volume Ratio for GME as of 2021-03-22. The way they calculate Short Volume Ratio is simply take the Short Volume figure from FINRA (**2,358,752**) divided by the Total Volume. Whao, but Fintel is showing **10,054,700** as the Total Volume for GME, what?

[Fintel uses the Short Volume figure from FINRA. Example: 2021-03-22, Short Volume for GME: 2,358,752. However, Fintel disagrees with FINRA in that Fintel uses 10,054,700 as the total volume whereas FINRA maintains GME only had 3,843,634 total volume.](https://preview.redd.it/5g4lhepc7po61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5c94c82d5a01181d73667ebeeb7feed416e25e)

Okay, let see then..

[ Yahoo Finance shows GME had a volume of 9,573,686 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/m3483d888po61.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=401ab28bc0b80a29c43d0ec4d358566bb035dae3)

[ WeBull shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/8v5abi8g8po61.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2cab05661faa8c6c1d132baa7eae18f7ebf79b)

[ Robinhood shows GME had a volume of 10,060,000 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/fp0t9tkn8po61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c3eacd125e70226892e147187be9189558a4084)

[ Fidelity shows GME had a volume of 10,061,505 on 2021-03-22.](https://preview.redd.it/nrkys7cv8po61.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=aee32b3251553ab514d1835f9fa0b540e5d9bb27)

You get the picture. Four sources confirmed that GME had a total volume of \~10M on 2021-03-22. Why the hell is FINRA reporting only 3.8M as the total volume? YES, I am aware that FINRA breaks down their report by markets. I specifically did the analysis based on their ""consolidated"" data across markets B *(NASDAQ TRF Chicago)*, Q *(NASDAQ TRF Carteret)* and N *(NYSE TRF)* So, what the hell?

Once I start questioning that, I had to check FINRA's short volume report for a longer time span for GME. Turns out, FINRA has been under-reporting total volume for all tickers since.. ever. Here I compare what FINRA is reporting vs what Yahoo and Fidelity are reporting. (Blue: FINRA, Red: Yahoo and Yellow: Fidelity)

[ GME Total Trading Volume as reported by FINRA, Yahoo & Fidelity \(2021-01-01 to 2021-03-22\) \[Check sources below raw data\]](https://preview.redd.it/wj18e4vpcpo61.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf1121443100b84f7e78e92b7c9c9ceafe96f44)

As you can see, Yahoo and Fidelity pretty much align 100% on what the total volume is, but FINRA ***\_never\_*** reported even remotely close to what others are reporting. Again, keep in mind the FINRA data I used in this analysis is consolidated across markets.

The ramification of using FINRA's short volume and the total volume of what everyone else is reporting is underestimating the short volume ratio. If we go by the total volume reported by FINRA, we actually get 2358752 / 3843634= **61.4%** Short Volume Ratio. However, sites like Fintel uses that 2358752 short volume figure and the total volume \~10M figure, that gives a low **23%** Short Volume Ratio. The difference is dramatic.

**The questions that need to be answered are: what is FINRA reporting? Why do the total volume they report so different than everybody else's? How confident and reliable are their Short Volume data then? If their consolidated data turns out to be not consolidated, are they deceiving the public in that services like Fintel report a fraction of the real Short Volume Ratio as a result?**

For the record, I did check other stocks *(blue chips, meme stocks, EV.. etc.)* FINRA ***\_always\_*** under-report the total volume.

&#x200B;

**EDIT TO ADD:**

[Fintel's definition on short volume.](https://preview.redd.it/8mhntjpp4to61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7285ff634d1f16e313ec990ddc9989509c01f)

Fintel takes the Short Volume figure from FINRA at face value and divided it by a number (total volume) that includes more markets than FINRA does. *(FINRA's total volume reported does not include or align with exchange volume and they only count trades that are ""publicly disseminated"")*

In the end, we learn that the data from FINRA is not complete *(perhaps there will never be a single source of truth when it comes to market data.)* and should not be taken at face value. You can use it to maybe gauge market direction, but it can not be used to accurately calculate the short volume ratio. *(Since, well.. both the numerator and denominator are subsets of the whole population. It is sampling at best. And sampling is well, sampling. It is not meant to be 100% accurate.)*

&#x200B;

TL;DR: FINRA allegedly report ~~inaccurate~~ **incomplete** total volume in their Short Sale Volume daily report and services like Fintel uses them and as a result gives **inaccurate** short volume ratio.

Yes today was a tough day. But take a step back and take a look at the big picture. We have formed a very nice ascending channel since Feb. 5 and have tested the bottom at least 5 times. Today we reached the bottom, and the chart is already showing signs of a bounce. We are looking to hold $10.50 support (bottom of the channel) and failing that, we have VERY strong support at $10. Retards, this shit is about to pull out the UNO reverse card and make the hedgies sweat. If you already paperhanded AMC/GME...fuck you....but now is your chance to jump back on the rocket!

With GME news about to flood the media, I would expect a nice green day tomorrow. Have faith APES. The squeeze isn't happening this week, but we are building up to it. I have the first two weeks of April marked on my calendar for the squeeze. Although, only the Hedge funds have an idea of when it will happen. Right now they are trying to bluff you off the rocket so HODL.

If I was to compare it to January, I would say this looks eerily similar to January 26th. Take a look at the MACD and RSI. Do you see what I see? See how much room we are giving ourselves to run? This shit is about to get wild!",2021-03-24 04:58:00

Hey guys,

 After the success of my [Elliot Wave Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I have decided to go ahead and do a simpler post about the most basic chart patterns. Now, most people claim technical analysis is bullshit, [""tea leaf reading for the financial community""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/grwq98u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [""astrology for men""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/grwpnwl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). But I assure you it is more than that. It is useful. I trade almost solely off of technical analysis, to great success. My favourite way to trade is based off of support and resistance, RSI, Moving Averages and then the basic chart patterns. The chart patterns in this post make up about 80% of all the patterns I trade.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3cnouyxvto61.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=d535d296efbeaa5ae09ff0230474e72bcdd84cf1

**Double tops and bottoms:**

* Double tops and double bottoms are reversal formations, signaling to chartists that a sustained trend may be about to reverse
* Double tops typically occur when two successive moves higher are sold into, creating two peaks on the chart. The low point between these two highs is known as the ""neckline"", and the pattern culminates with a break through this level
* On this occasion you see that a second top fails to break above the initial high. This indicates that the uptrend may have finished  and a reversal is likely. It's sensible to enter your trade below/below (depending on whether its a top or bottom), when the pattern is fully formed (because another pattern may be forming, such as a triple top)
* The benefit of trading a pattern such as a double top is that it also gives you a price target. The difference in price is likely to be equal to the difference from the neckline to the highest/lowest peak 
* Double bottoms are the same as double tops, only inverted. They signal bullish reversals

&#x200B;

[Double top](https://preview.redd.it/sf0uh2d4wto61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=0433ebf55464f6e17bce21ec063eccfc4d207198)

**Triple Tops and Bottoms**

* The same as double tops and bottoms, except the market hits support/resistance three times before reversing

&#x200B;

[Triple top on Spy](https://preview.redd.it/whzgb80awto61.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6507d89616e996b98250a3e2d4779fdb33ff17)

**Head and Shoulders**

* This is another pattern signaling a trend reversal. Ver similar to triple tops, but this time you get a peak (left shoulder), followed by a higher peak (head), followed by a lower peak (right shoulder)
* The neckline is formed between the two troughs on either side of the head. If the neckline's sloping down that's an even better indication of a reversal
* You calculate target price based on the distance between the head and the neckline - just add/subtract that distance to/from the breakout point
* It is worth noting that a head and shoulder's patter is only complete once the neckline is broken
* Inverse head and shoulders work the same, only in the other direction

&#x200B;

[Inverse head and shoulders on Spy](https://preview.redd.it/jy5prbvmwto61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d015b7bd3de4605e39d20fa1f9ab836b55c6cd07)

**Triangles**

I already covered triangles from an Elliot Wave perspective in my series on Elliot Wave Theory (linked at the top of this post). So this is just going to be a quick summary on triangles

*Ascending Triangles*

* Forms as the market hits a strong level of horizontal resistance, but a series of higher lows indicate that the market is converging towards it
* This pattern usually signals that the price will move higher but its possible that the resistance level might be too strong, causing the price to bounce off 
* Generally, the best strategy is to trade the breakout
* There is usually a re-test of the horizontal resistance level after the break, to establish it as a new support level. The conservative trader could wait for the backtest before entering

*Descending Triangles*

* Works in the opposite way to ascending triangles
* The market hits a level of support, but a series of successively lower peaks suggests the price will move lower

*Symmetrical Triangle*

* Occurs when the price appears to be converging with a series of lower peaks and higher troughs (lows). This is a continuation pattern, which means the market will usually continue in the same direction as the overall trend after the pattern has formed
* If theres no clear trend before the triangle, the breakout is equally likely to be up or down. Its possible to trade this scenario with a ""one cancels the other"" market order. Place an order to buy above and sell below the triangle, and if one gets triggered, the other gets cancelled.

&#x200B;

[Symmetrical Triangle on Copper - happening right now](https://preview.redd.it/djbyzgevwto61.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=194484ed17683bc6b6247e604335bd87808aa341)

**Rectangles**

* Similar to symmetrical triangles, these are continuation patterns that mark consolidation in the current trend before a continued move
* After a strong move, the market will usually consolidate a while, establishing a clear rectangle formed between support and resistances. This is essentially to establish a sustainable trend and to give people time to mentally accept that the new higher/lower price is a reasonable price, before pushing them to new prices again

&#x200B;

[Rectangle](https://preview.redd.it/0egvhfr8xto61.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fe6190a88f23f684f34e534397ea8c643afcb0c)

**Wedges**

Not to be confused with triangles, these patterns are formed when the price of a market begins to narrow into a tight range between two sloping trend lines

*Rising Wedge*

* Occurs between two upwardly sloping  lines of support and resistance. In this case the line of support is steeper than the resistance line
* This pattern generally signals that price will push lower

*Falling Wedge*

* Occurs between two downwardly sloping levels. In this case, the line of resistance is steeper than the line of support, and usually signals that the price will move higher

&#x200B;

[Falling wedges](https://preview.redd.it/6eyrpwkmxto61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09bca12c69bcbdb9aef96a82ac976a493967a3a)

With all chart patterns, its usually best to trade the breakouts.

# TL;DR

Think like a customer. Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.

Walk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?

When you’ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.

# Purpose

Disclaimer: Don’t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!

Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**
* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**
* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# First Phase: Real Estate

Walk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?

https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8

Ultimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf

The reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.

&#x200B;

# Second Phase: Customer Service

You as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey’s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.

https://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6

Ask yourself:

\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?

\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?

\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?

– Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?

\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?

\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?

&#x200B;

# Summary

Despite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the “custom” in customer.

Listen up, apes.  I'm about to give an explanation of what I think is going to happen.  Even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it.  Now, I know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal, or really anything with meaningful content, so let's just talk about card games.

How do casinos make money on poker?  For each hand of poker played, the casino takes a small percentage of the pot, which is called the rake.  The casino provides the establishment and the dealers, the players play, and the casino takes its commission.  Okay, great, but what the fuck does this have to do with GME?  We're getting there.  Hang on.  The edging is real, but you'll get your payoff.

So the casino takes its cut from each pot.  The more money in the pot, the more money the casino makes.  Great.  How do they maximize profits?  Well, they can bring in more players, get players to play longer, deal more hands per hour, and/or increase the average size of the pots.  I'm not going to answer how they accomplish most of these, because it doesn't matter.  What matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains.  The point here is that you don't need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money, you just need to understand their business model.

Let's focus on how to increase the average size of the pots.  There are tons of ways to do this, but let's assume that instead of being in a giant casino, you're at a local back-alley gambling spot.   Their operation isn't super sophisticated.  They just install a few of their cronys into each game.  Each idiot has roughly the same set of goals: bring people in, loosen up the tables, and create big pots.   As long as the gangsters don't put too much money on the table (and lose it), the house will profit.

There's one key point here that I haven't mentioned yet.  No one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldn't play and the house wouldn't make money, right?  Well, that's not entirely true.  In fact, it's not at all true.  Then why the fuck did I mention it?  Well, you tell me, why the fuck would you play a rigged game?

Even if the game is rigged and the players know that it's a sham, if it's the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth, they will still play.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  In fact, it's even a good thing for the house when ""dumb money"" make money; this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends.  They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.

The house wants you to play.  The house wants your friends to play.  The house wants everyone to play.  So how do you make sure that as many people as possible play?  Did you fucking read the last paragraph?  It's simple: you make it the best way for anyone to make money.  You essentially force them to play.  Don't get lost in the details.   It doesn't matter how this is accomplished.  They can lick you, suck you, fuck you, beat you, squeeze you, whack the other competition off, etc.  All that matters is that whatever game they run, it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery.

So what happens when players make too much money?  I don't know, what happens when there's a bug in your favorite game's code?  What happens when the sheep start misbehaving?  A short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep, but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame.  Again, the game is rigged, and  the minions have one fucking job: follow the script and don't get too greedy.  Any problem, and I mean any problem, is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and it's not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood.  

Reddit is an enormous echo chamber.  Shit gets loud in here, but as much as your tiny minds focus on GME, most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big, they're not going to care.  They're too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery.

So what the hell am I actually saying about GME?  The apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused, but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand.  There's going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some ""Epsteins,"" but as long as the apes don't fold, the apes win this round.  If the mobsters play this game right, they'll fold this hand, take their losses, and (as usual) end up winning in the long run.  They just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff.  This is EZ mode.

Do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine?  It doesn't matter if you're a friend of the family, a bigly minion, or even the fucking godfather.  You live by the sword, you die by the sword.  When you have an infected limb, you first try to treat it, but if that doesn't work, you cut that shit off.  These people are fucking cannibals and they don't mind eating their own--I'm sure that some of them even prefer it.  The shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder, and the cannibals are going to feast.

https://preview.redd.it/tw8ak8fdluo61.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=bafcc5248a25c1e2725c739a333d6723b79af4dc

The March 23 Report is much like the earnings call, in fact one could say it was just a rehearsal of the details in the report. Aside from the financial results, we see the board appointments and Jenna Owens ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens/?trk=public\_profile\_browsemap\_mini-profile\_title](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens/?trk=public_profile_browsemap_mini-profile_title)) as Chief Operating Officer. It doesn't specify who the all important Chief Tech Officer will be, but other sources confirm Matt Francis ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis/)). They've massively reduced short-term debt, however this quarter has not seen a change it seems in long term debt.

One thing I thought was really cool that isn't mentioned in the report is the introduction of a larger selection of gaming peripherals (chairs, keyboards, desks) into their product lineup. The CEO mentioned this and I think it's important, that they want to escape the cyclical 'console release-based' model they've functioned under in order to take in more consistent customer flow. Twitch is growing MASSIVELY, and will continue to grow as more and more people are pulled into the incredibly lucrative platform. This growth will push sales of VR gear, keyboards, mice, monitors, and desks. All of these products will be prime product categories for GME in the near and long term.

One other thing that was emphasized was increased efficiency in logistics and order fulfillment. I assume this is a callback to the recent struggle with next-gen console supply. I think the appointment of both a Chief Tech Officer and Chief Operating Officer who worked previously with Amazon is a clear signal that they're pushing heavily to dominate the e-commerce gaming space and massively cut down on inefficiencies in their fulfillment pipeline.

Altogether, in my opinion these administrative changes along with the clearly healthy financial condition of the company give it a solid foundation to build up their online platform and offer better deals to customers in order to remain truly competitive in the market.",2021-03-24 06:03:52
75,Why is Rolls Royce PLC so undervalued?,61,mbmovt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbmovt/why_is_rolls_royce_plc_so_undervalued/,100,"First and foremost, I want to clarify that Rolls Royce PLC is a **separate** company from Rolls Royce Motors Ltd.

Rolls Royce PLC is the division that handles manufacturing of Turbofans for large passenger and freight planes and operates under the ticker $LSE:RR, but I am talking about their US traded ADR, $RYCEY in this post.

I was looking into it and saw on their financials they average about $5-6 billion in revenue per quarter. Now the pandemic definitely hurt their numbers but according to market watch they’re still completely on track.

Their total debt actually shrunk last quarter from 41b to 34b, liabilities from 16b to 13b, and their total accounts receivable only shrunk by a small margin in comparison.

They charge clients on a per-mile-flown basis so these numbers tell me that even during the pandemic they were still resilient enough to make close to their average revenue. Their inventory continues to fluctuate at a healthy rate.

They laid off 1,400 employees in November of last year and just culled another 9,000 employees from their global workforce. These kinds of cuts can be good or bad. If their revenue was much much worse I would easily conclude the more likely scenario is they are failing and flailing, but with their revenue still on-par with pre covid returns, it seems highly possible that this is a smart practice of “trimming the fat” from their corporation. Many jobs can be replaced with new online tools (SaaS) and other means of automation. I think Rolls Royce has finally realized this and is preparing for an overhaul on every level.

While this company is not an airline, it is still the second largest turbofan manufacturer in the world rivaled only by GE. Pre-pandemic shares of $RYCEY were trading at $10+, now down to $1.50 despite Rolls Royce’s earnings not being as heavily impacted as some other companies like American Airlines, Boeing, and others we’ve seen make a decent recovery from the pandemic’s toll. I feel like this stock is being neglected for multiple reasons, of which I’m sure some people wrongly think it’s associated to the company that makes $500,000 cars that not many people own.

Glad to hear your opinions and I hope I’m missing something, if so - please let me know why people seem to hate this stock so much!",2021-03-24 03:30:30

But here’s some background:

1. MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). ""DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays"".
2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)

If I use my body as an example, my brain tells my body what to do, but without my spinal cord, I'm useless.

* Brain = Processor
* Body = Display
* DDIC = Spinal Cord

# History

1. **MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-surpasses-the-500-million-milestone-in-cumulative-shipments-of-display-driver-ics-for-oled-screens-300891577.html)

What is OLED? OLED is the next generation of screens.

* TV went from Tube - LCD - LED
* Phones are going from LCD - OLED

1. **The issue was, MX was so early to the game (in 2003) that no one was ready for OLED. Smartphones didn't even exist yet. So while MX kept producing other products such as DDIC for LCD, MX kept preparing and developing their baby, knowing that the secret sauce was in the OLED.**

# So what has changed? 5G AND OLED!

1. **As you all know, 5G is going to become the norm within the next 2-3 years.**

If you have been living under a rock, 5G is the next generation in cellular connectivity, 100x faster which is going to open all sorts of opportunities for the world.

When phone manufacturers introduce the new ""latest and greatest"", you can't give a phone with 5G lightning speeds but not upgrade everything else! So manufacturers upgrade other parts of the phone to continuously justify the price point.

2. **Manufacturers need to add things like:**

* Better/slimmer designs
* Faster processors
* New Colors
* But most obviously, better quality screens.

Screens have become more important especially with the rise of the mobile gaming industry. Reports estimate that by the end of 2020, mobile game revenue will hit $76.7 billion, more than the film and music industry combined. - [source](https://www.ironsrc.com/blog/top-51-mobile-app-and-gaming-statistics/). We all know you can't be playing Fortnite or watch Youtube while looking at a potato screen.

# Connecting MX and the rise of 5G

MX has been waiting 18 years for this day to come.

* **MX has recently launched their new DDIC product lines which feature** **a 28nm OLED DDIC (down from 40nm) = smaller thinner phone. The DDIC's also feature -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-launches-28-nanometer-oled-ddic-for-smartphone-displays-300831906.html)
* 120hz High Frame Rate (HFR) = smoother picture, especially for gaming.
* compatibility with various display types = rigid, flexible, foldable, VR/AR
* reduction in power voltage from 1.1v to 1.0 = reducing power consumption by more than 20% and extending battery life
* reduction in Electromagnetic Interference by 20% = clearer phone calls
* support for Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) displays = more power efficient backplane = extending battery life

https://preview.redd.it/sdbr7vzuqso61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab9c244e170feb1f49ac66a3506693470c7d93b

**In addition, the 28nm OLED DDIC are going to be made in 300mm fabs (factories) = greater profit margin**

* Chips are made in fabs, usually on 200 or 300mm wafers. - [source](http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/CEICM/SECTION7.pdf)
* 200mm wafers was technology introduced in 1992,
* This is similar to trying to boil 1 million eggs in a medium sized saucepan.
* In addition, the saucepan is old and it's possible that the eggs might get cracked = lower yield/lower margins.
* 300mm wafers are the new standard in making chip making 1 million eggs in a shiny large pot (which has a lower chance of eggs getting cracked) = higher yield/ higher margin

# OLEDs are booming:

# A few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):

1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want

* OLED Screen
* 120hz HFR
* LPTO Displays

1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)
2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)

5. AND some frigid weather knocked out Samsung's Austin plant that makes OLED DDICs for Apple  (still shut down as of two weeks ago [source](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/03/10/samsungs-austin-fab-still-shut-down-weeks-after-texas-freeze/6924766002/)). Do you think Apple wants to have all its eggs in one basket going forward?

# Valuation

**Despite a nice run in YTD 2021, MX is still dirt cheap, trading at 8-9x Adj. 2021 EBITDA, which is dirt cheap for a high growth technology stonk.**

**Competitor in the space and recent acquisitions have been at much higher multiples.**

**I think the company will easily hit $65-70mm EBITDA in 2021 and rerate to a higher EV multiple, in line with competitors who are valued at a 25x-35x EV/EBITDA multiple: 100% upside. Longer term, as OLEd gains further traction and takes share from LCD and penetrates into TV, automotive, and gaming smartphones, 2023 EBITDA could grow to well north of $150mm with MX worth potentially 10x its current market cap.**

With the upcoming Annual Meeting on April 8th, Nokia's PR Department has been working feverishly with announcements of all their new 5G Contracts (Orange, TMUS, T, etc...), Partnerships (AMZN, GOOG, MSFT), Licensing Agreements (Samsung), and the like (5G World Record speeds & IoT initatives) as you can see for yourself.  

The BIG announcement at the Annual Meeting will be the Buyback approval of 550M shares by the company.  Nokia has $8.3B in Cash and Cash Equivalents on their Balance Sheet so I expect the buyback (Approx. $2.1B in cash) to be completed almost immediately following the annual meeting.  That will lower Nokia's Cash balance to Approx. $6B as compared to Ericsson which has $5.3B in Cash on their balance sheet.

Blackrock is the only Top Wall Street Investor in Nokia with over 330M shares (greater than 5%) of the company.  Once the buyback is approved, expect other Wall Street firms to join in the name and move Nokia toward 2X Annual Revenue of $26B or a $52B Market Cap.  ($52B Market Cap / 5.1B shares outstanding = $10.20 share price)  

With proven revenue growth and increasing Operating Margins throughout 2021, Nokia should see their valuation increase toward 3X Annual Revenue which would equate to $15 to $20 per share by the end of the year/early 2022.  

Investors will be happy that they bought in at $4 per share, but will be OK investing when Nokia reaches $5.",2021-03-24 05:59:01

You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.

This is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:

**What they do:**

Their main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the ""building"" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).

As a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.

**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**

JFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.

I'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-

* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package
* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory
* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray
* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines
* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution

As the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**

**Other big growth catalysts:**

You may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack or ""dependency confusion"". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.

With each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.

**Company Background**

Founded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the ""Universal Repo"" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.

I've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**

They acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.

They went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.

**Financials**

Comps here are based on the segment they operate in.

DataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. 

Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. 

* Net Dollar Retention
   * **FROG: 139%**
   * DDOG: 130%
   * CRWD: 125%
   * TEAM: 132%
* GAAP Earnings: As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.
   * **FROG: -$0.1861**
   * DDOG: -$0.05
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Market cap:
   * **FROG: $4.9 B**
   * DDOG: $26.3 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Forward P/E Ratio
   * **FROG: 615**
   * DDOG: 666
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* No long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* GAAP Margin is 81%
* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions

**Ownership**

65% owned by insiders and institutions. Most of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. ARK just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago. Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.

**Summary**

JFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.

For anyone who wants to know more about Aphria's history, I suggest you guys read those posts first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made.

# Introduction

Okay retards, I lied. I said my previous post would be my last before merger, but with recent developments I could not help but make another post. My last post was also pretty badly timed for anyone looking to hold until merger, price was around $23.7 then. The price did go up to about $32 in the next few days so you could have also made a huge profit if you sold on the way up. But I advised you guys to hold until merger so I might have involuntarily created some bagholders with my last post, for which I'm sorry. To those who are holding through losses, don't despair. Aphria has a bright future ahead with the Tilray merger now in its final stage. That's what I'll be talking about in this post, so anyone interested please read.

# Merger finalizing: arbitrage opportunity largely vanished

For anyone who doesn't know, on April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting where they'll vote on the merger and on April 16th Tilray will do the same for their shareholders. This was announced about a week ago. Both companies cooperated in making a website for their shareholders on [www.aphriatilraytogether.com](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com) with all the information you could possibly need. I especially recommend the Investors and FAQ sections. I know you guys are lazy fucks so I will summarize the most important info in bullet points:

* **On April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting at 4 pm EST on** [**www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021**](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)**. However, only registered shareholders can ask questions and vote on the merger. We can attend as guests if we fill out an online form.** Only shareholders with a significant position are registered. Most of us retail traders hold shares through an intermediary (brokers) so we can't vote unless the intermediary gives us notice. 
* **Both boards are unanimously in favor of the merger and are encouraging shareholders to vote FOR the merger.** Major shareholders will follow the board's advice. So sit back and relax, this merger thing will go through.
* **Each holder of Aphria shares will receive 0.8381 of a Tilray Share for each Aphria Share. There will be no fractional Tilray shares.** I'll clarify this with a numerical example. I have 30 shares of Aphria, so I should receive 0.8381\*30 = 25.14 Tilray shares. But there are no fractional shares, so I round down to the nearest whole number: I will receive 25 Tilray shares on merger date. The transaction should go through without any additional costs or taxes.
* **Often mergers go through about a month after shareholders voted on it. Following this logic,**   
**a potential merger date should be sometime in the middle of May.** I should say that this is not all at confirmed by either Aphria and Tilray, but it is just based on common practice. The exact merger date will probably be announced a week beforehand.

In my previous posts I always underlined that there was a small chance that the merger doesn't go through or that the merger split would be changed. Those two chances have both become 0% since the announcement of the meetings and creation of that website. This is why the arbitrage opportunity that I also highlighted in my last two posts has largely disappeared. 

Currently Aphria is noted at $18.53 and Tilray at $23.56, which makes the split 0.7865 so the difference to the merger split has almost disappeared at a 0.0516 margin. This is probably due to big players on the stock market noticing and closing the gap. You can still buy in right now with a small benefit, but it's no longer a big lucrative play. Anyone still looking to buy in should just do it for the merger and the positive future of the cannabis market globally.

**TLDR:** Last week Aphria and Tilray confirmed their merger with upcoming shareholder meetings and an informative website ([AphriaTilrayTogether](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com)). Voting on the merger is finalized after the meetings on April 14th and 16th. Shareholders will surely vote in favor of the merger, so the potential merger date should be somewhere in the middle of May (not confirmed). Arbitrage opportunity is now almost fully gone.

**Position:** Nothing changed, my 30 shares @ $8.74 are still standing strong.",2021-03-23 21:32:24

109,Long on AAL,31,mbllal,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbllal/long_on_aal/,27,"For the last few weeks I have been following airline stocks quite closely. From what I have gathered, American Airlines is undervalued. I have multiple reasons why and will explain them below. What I am going to show you is why I like the stock.

Lets start with a comparison.

[AAL\_Comparison\_03232021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjXuI8XNQC2D7xGnP-oAGfS0d4k7sFh0QMVgYa7aRUU/edit?usp=sharing)

I comprised all similar airlines along with AAL into one spreadsheet, displaying their current value as of today, along with Market Cap, Income, and Sales. AAL is currently valued, according to these numbers, about 20 points lower than it should be. Of course though, this is just my opinion based on these numbers. Lets look at some more factual data.

&#x200B;

American Airlines is the largest passenger airline in the world, with roughly 1440 aircraft and 900 operational at any time. Because of this, American Airlines is in control of the passenger market. 

[Airline Wikipedia Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America)

This data shows up to 2020, which gives a good idea of what the pandemic has inflicted on this industry. Yes, numbers are low but we need to look at where we are headed.

&#x200B;

According to this data, we are looking at 85% vaccinated by Dec. In my opinion, the speed at which we are administering vaccines, I think May will be primed for at least 40% vaccinated. Most states are sitting at somewhere between 10-20% vaccinated. The US in total is 13.5% fully vaccinated, with 24.9% having at least received one dose. This wide of a spread between first and second doses, tells me that we are moving fast towards a majority vaccinated.

[NPR Vaccination Visualization](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state)

&#x200B;

There is a lot of data about every country and its reopening plan. Link below will show an article with most countries plan to reopen. This data to me, is a bit more convoluted, and subject to change at any moment depending on new cases of the virus. From what I have gathered, some countries would rather be open for tourists, mainly Caribbean countries. Others, like large EU players, are staying shut for much longer. Less reliable data, but still data none the less. What it tells me, is that there is places to go if you want to fly. 

[Reopening Plans](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/reopening-soon-a-country-by-country-guide-to-coronavirus-recovery/)

&#x200B;

On a less positive note, American Airlines sentiment is low. 

[Forbes Top Airlines 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2020/05/04/the-best-and-worst-airlines-of-2020/?sh=72e8ed0e1a8e)

American Airlines is last on the list, and for many good reasons. A recent merger, and internal company issues has made this airline a difficult one to manage and project a good face. I believe with a bit of time, they will be back up higher on this list. Controlling the largest fleet of aircraft allows for some lee way when it comes to passenger complaints. From speaking to friends in different cities, I have found that American Airlines is sometimes the only way to go. This is not hard data. This is simply an understanding that with the largest fleet, comes the ability to set your own price and do things your way. If American Airlines is the only option, people will be forced to fly AA. 

&#x200B;

In my honest opinion, I see at least a 10 point gain if not more, from this stock. I like this stock and see it as an easy investment, with returns as early as may, as late as August.

&#x200B;

Do your own DD before investing, as always. Again, I like the stock.

I feel confident that the shorts have this one wrong, but thought the best way to combat my confirmation bias would be to get publicly humiliated by a bunch of other Apes.

***Safe harbor***: I am not qualified to give financial advice. Do not trade based solely on my feelings about this companies prospects - do your own damn research and make your own damn decisions.

Description/Profile from Yahoo Fin below for anyone unaware:

*Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer in the United States. The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website.*

&#x200B;

* **Academy financials:** *I've opted to use Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as the industry benchmark here - not perfect, but similar enough to help understand the relative financial health of ASO compared to the market leader*
   * Market Cap: 2.25B (*DKS 7B*)
   * Trailing P/E: 9.31 (*DKS 13.83*)
   * Operating Cash Flow (ttm): 1.03B (*DKS 1.55B)*
   * Current Ratio (liquidity): 1.61 *(DKS 1.47) - for folks who don't look at the balance sheet too often, current ratio is the comparison of current assets to current liabilities. Higher number typically indicates that you have a healthy balance of assets/liabilities - though too high could mean you aren't taking enough risk or appropriately levered.*
   * **Q3 2020 Earnings:** Q3 2020 sales were up 18% vs prior year. **Think about Q3 2020 -** most of the country still in lockdown, tensions rising and people flocked to these stores as a materialism escape OR to ready their defenses. Gross margin of 33% which was up 110 bps over previous year in the middle of the pandemic - great control of costs.
* **Dick's Measuring**: One area I think a lot of people are missing when comparing to Dick's ($DKS) is that, while ASO is more niche and not yet as widely recognized, the sales per store is significantly higher due to the fanaticism and mix of goods sold here. As ASO continues expanding (currently only in 16 states!), Revenue will catch up to DKS quickly and the increase in scale will improve margins:
   * ASO: 260 stores with 5.5 B in Revenue (ttm) = **21M per store**
   * DKS: 850 stores with 8.7 B in Rev = **10.2M per store**
   * This tells me that either **Academy is doing a better job in how they select the physical locations for their stores, or they have a stronger mix of online to brick and mortar sales than DKS**
* **Public Listing Fuel**: To me, ASO has significant upside - that being said, the stock price has essentially doubled since its listing as shorts continue to double down. ASO has an excellent opportunity to utilize this price growth as fuel for expansion. Currently, only about 1/3 of their total shares outstanding are considered floating shares, most likely due to the post-IPO lock-down  (more to come on this in the ""what scares me section"" below).
   * At this point about 8% of shares are held by insiders vs 4% for DKS. This is a good sign to me and a vote of confidence in upward movement, but will be keeping an eye on this figure after the lock-out period expires.
* **Guns and Butter**: Sure, we can make the argument that gun/ammo sales are through the roof - an area that ASO plays in that DKS does not. For me, this offers more of a short term benefit than anything - a potential catalyst for stronger than expected earnings however not sure we can hang our hopes and dreams on everyone in America buying a small arsenal.

&#x200B;

* Here is what scares me:
   * ASO has only recently become public. A few stray assumptions can cause turmoil down the road as the steady state of the business becomes clear.
   * On top of this, the ""lock out"" period for company insiders expires at the end of this month - they have also placed their Q4 earnings the day before this lock-out expires. Read into that as you will.
   * Of course, on top of all of this, the company itself needs to be managed well from the top. They have made a few recent notable personnel moves (Tom Nealson from Southwest Airlines appointed to board), however I know little about the track record or competence of the leadership at Academy.

""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

Mainly I want to touch on the misconception that Palantir is not profitable and that they're losing more and more money year by year. I'll try to show why Aunt Cathie, Vanguard and Soros Fund Management aren't actually high.

Buckle up boomer.

Before we get to that I want to briefly discuss the current market environment and the potential for further dips (potentially even dips of dips of dips a.k.a. megadips) in the near future as to inform some of you newer YOLOers about what this whole 10 YR Treasury Yield shit is all about and why you should care. It might potentially save you some money. If you're familiar with the inverse correlation of growth stock prices and the treasury yields/inflation expectations, just skip ahead.

At the end I'd like to compare PLTR's current situation with industry peers and compare their forecasted developments.

# Valuation of Growth Stocks & 10 YR Treasury Yield

Now why is Palantir dipping more than other tech stocks like Apple or Google? Was it just a pump and dump? Are people leaving? To answer that question we'll have to look at how people valuate companies. The most widely used method is the Discounted Cash Flow method. In simplified terms you look at a company's future cash flows, discount them at some interest rate, add some fancy terminal value and what not (don't worry about that) and you end up with the current company's valuation.

[This is a simplified version of the DCF valuation - you can get all fancy with this](https://preview.redd.it/vkpao2965no61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=1888f4c171b6a8dea8bd03574556e9c7d8299d39)

Now when treasury rates rise - the discount rate (r) rises - your Cashflow gets smaller. The further out in the future your cashflows are - the more you're affected by rising interest rates. Hence why companies with valuations based on cashflows that are far out are more strongly affected by those rising rates. The big Cash Flows are a few years out and are being discounted at (1+r) \^ many years.

Below you'll see how MSFT, GOOGL & AAPL's market caps are a lot less affected than newer companies such as Tesla (moderately new), PLTR and Snowflake - they're all ""tech"" stocks but tech  **≠** same growth expectations for all tech companies.

**TLDR**: If treasury yields continue to rise we might see growth stock prices go even lower due to people valuating these stocks at a lower price due to the increasing discount rate (r). That's just a little disclaimer I wanted to get out of the way - the macroeconomic environment matters a whole lot for these stocks.

Now let's get to the sawwssee

# PLTR Revenue Expectations vs. Peers

Some numbers incoming - bear with me it'll get better.

So this one's pretty straightforward. Palantir increased their revenues by 47% between FY 2019 and FY 2020. The revenues from government operations in 2018 accounted for 43% (255m $) of total revenues, commercial revenue accounted for 57% (340m $) - In 2020 Government revenues accounted for 56% (610m $), commercial revenues accounted for 44% (482.5m $) of total revenues.

So many numbers I know - hold on. Between 2018 and 2020 PLTR had a roughly 150% increase in government revenues and a roughly 40% increase in commercial revenues. Now the good news - we're not even close to being done yet.

Here's a quick take (copy pasta from a  [previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma4b3b/pltr_analyst_ratings_fud_bad_faith_and_abusing/)  I made) on the potential growth of government revenues going forward:

>If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first private company to ever get that [level of clearance](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/1/27/2312271-1611785323344723_origin.png). That could attract other governments' military organisations like the UK, France, Germany etc. (assuming a cooperation with US allies is possible and doesn't jeopardize their current contracts with the US Military).

So [Palantir state](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-47-for-Full-Year-2020-Expects-Q1-2021-Revenue-Growth-of-45) that they're expecting **AT LEAST** 30% YoY growth in FY 2021 and I don't expect Papa Karp to underdeliver. Analysts predict a 35% increase. Now what's even more interesting is that actual profit metrics (EBITDA, EBIT, Net Income) are expected to grow from roughly 50% - 70% respectively - Palantir is going to be profitable very soon (they actually already are - or close to being profitable at least, but more on that later).

[Analyst Forecasts for profitability \/ growth metrics](https://preview.redd.it/5zrjp184hno61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=40a8ac792091fabc1437d07b71a1111321edbf01)

Now you might say ""the price targets are completely off - why trust these analysts when it comes to financial forecasts"" - truth be told, the forecasts on KPIs were a lot more accurate than the PTs. Although they were off by a mile on some of the KPIs (predicted a Net Income of 124 when it was actually 197, I've noticed that analysts have always underestimated those metrics with Palantir - so the following figures might actually end up being a low-ball estimate/bear case) - the mean prediction of revenues was 1072 vs. 1093 actual revenues, so that's pretty accurate.

[Pretty accurate mean revenue estimate - GJ](https://preview.redd.it/vlbdhrnqrno61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a26d86c0ceb917476c0f6a9c760bfa32d688915)

# Profitability

Okay - now to Palantir's profitability. I want to dismiss the following kind of comments and have you apes understand why PLTR is Soros Fund Management LLC's 2nd largest position, why it accounts for 21% of Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC's portfolio, why Vanguard is literally just telling Papa Karp to take their money, why Aunt Cathie is all over this stock.

[Stock based compensation 5xed in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 - that's what happens when you IPO](https://preview.redd.it/06msu3oukno61.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0354cc01aa4b5ec4baad220cc0cb7d61aa6177b)

So look at Datadog, Snowflake, Dynatrace, they all IPO'd between 2019 and 2020. You see how the stock based compensation accounts for a huge chunk of their net loss (Datadog's Stock Price Compensation was 74M$ vs. 24.5M$ net loss - substract that from the net loss and they're actually up 50M$)? That's not the case for mature companies like Adobe -  why's that? u/ugh_stupidpeople explains that pretty nicely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/ll646o/stock_based_compensation/gnnm3fx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The gist is that employees get a a percentage of their salaries payed out as shares, when they IPO the following happens (in the PLTR case):

>The higher PLTR's stock price goes, the more its stock-based compensation numbers reported in earnings will increase, until pre-IPO compensation agreements expire. That's because the quantity of shares they're paying their employees was fixed pre-IPO. Higher price x same # of shares = higher cost reported. This will end as those pre-IPO compensation agreements expire.  
>  
>If Palantir's stock hadn't tripled since going public, their stock-based comp numbers would be much lower.  
>  
>\- u/ugh_stupidpeople

All else staying constant - if Palantir had the same Stock Based Compensation as they reported 2019 a.k.a. if they hadn't IPOed - they'd have an adjusted net loss of around 140 mio as opposed to the reported 1.166B$. If you deduct the 241m $ from the reported net loss of 579m $ (= 338m $), the adj. net loss would've been half that, in other words their net income would've increased by 50% not decreased by 100%. Deduct all costs that don't actually affect the operational activities of PLTR (First figure in the revenue section) you actually end up with a positive net income of 197.15M$ - Surprise, Palantir's operational activities are actually profitable, it's just the whole finance overhead (also strategical tax reasons) dragging the reported Net Income down.

>""BuT YoU'rE JuSt TwIsTiNg ThE NuMbeRs To MaKe It LoOk GoOd""

If that's what you're thinking right now, ask yourself if that ""expense"" actually reflects the companies' operational profitability - did it destroy value in any way, is the increasing net loss attributable to bad leadership and a shitty product? It's clearly not. It's just screwing us - the shareholders over in the short run - employees have gotten a disproportionate amount of shares (could Papa Karp have expected the share price to 4x - high of 38$ - or even 3x - current levels - from its IPO valuation in a matter of weeks? Doubt). Those employees are dumping those shares at every fucking spike.

I suspect that's one of the reasons behind Papa Karp's infamous quote ""Fuck off if you're here for the short term gains - we'll be dumping our shares because we're tired of eating ramen every fucking night"".

Remember how the price sky-rocketed to 40ish $ and came crashing down back to the 20s - a big part of that was the lock-in expiring a.k.a. employees cashing in at the top (They actually bought low and sold high, not like some of you apes). This all ends in max. 5 years - the dumping will be a lot less significant though as time goes by - when the pre-IPO Stock Based Compensations will have expired and the employees will be getting a less disproportionate amount of shares in relation to the current market price.

Now the good news is: These stock based compensations are expected to half by next year (see picture above), the profitability margins are expected to rise and the overall numbers are expected to grow - Palantir should be reporting around 320m $ + Net Income and in 5 years those pre-IPO stock compensation agreements will all have expired.

# Some blabber about CoGs, scalability and R&D expenditures (based on 3rd picture - Analyst Forecasts, I'm not gonna label the figures with Fig. 1 etc., we're still just on Reddit)

The CoGs (Cost of Goods Sold) are expected to stay more or less constant - that's in line with what Papa Karp always said. Palantir's services/products are organised in a way that they can be deployed to more customers without having to spend an amount proportionate to their revenue growth - don't ask me how, I'm not a fucking engineer, check the DD I linked at the bottom of the post if you're into those technicalities. Same goes for companies like Amazon AWS - double the amount of customers, get another server and maybe hire 10% more employees (I don't know the exact figures, as I said, I'm not a fucking engineer but you get the point).

R&D expenditures will grow by 40% and 20% in FY 2021 and FY 2022 respectively - I like to see that, that means they're investing to create a more competitive product. Consider they've had a pretty hostile relationship with IBM until IBM eventually gave up and partnered with PLTR - now imagine those Apollo/Foundry/Gotham testicles growing even larger.

# Peer Analysis

Now this all sounds pretty nice, is Palantir just giga special, one of a kind? No - the data analytics/data management - basically everything that has to do with data industry is growing like there's no tomorrow. Here a few quotes to highlight that (actual scientific literature - I know my brain hurts too, we're done soon):

>The size of the digital universe was roughly 130 billion gigabytes in 1995. By 2020, this number will swell to 40 trillion gigabytes.  
>  
>\- Professor Murtaza Haider (Professor of Data Science)

&#x200B;

>By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions  
>  
>\- McKinsey Global Institute

Okay, so there'll be exponentially more data year by year, we can gain insights from that data to improve our business decisions and save a literal fuck ton of money by doing so. [Airbus for example claims](https://skywise.airbus.com/en/about-skywise.html) that they've managed to speed up their A350 production process by 33% just by using PLTR's services. Now that's deep fucking value - not u/DeepFuckingValue deep fucking value I mean actual deep fucking value - literal millions/billions saved.

[So here are the forecasted Revenue Growths for PLTR's industry peers](https://preview.redd.it/f229ofiqvno61.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dac321953bfd0559e3249df594f81cd2dcfb466)

Now see, when Papa Karp says 30% annual growth and Jefferie's says 40% annual growth - they're not actually high, that industry is just growing at an abnormal pace. By the end of FY 2023 PLTR's revenues (according to analyst estimates and assuming Papa Karp's 30% YoY growth) will have increased by 127% - crazy right? Well - Snowflake's projected to grow by 388% (although I'm a bit skeptical about that one). So on a Peer Median (92.3%) Palantir's 127% revenue growth doesn't actually sound too absurd (Snowflake 388% on the other hand - not sure).

Snowflake does have an impressive track record when it comes to their revenue growth (3x their revenues from 2018-2019, almost 3x from 2019-2020) hence why they have that valuation. However they're growing from a significantly smaller base than PLTR (roughly 60% of PLTR's revenues in FY 2020). Now remember the first topic we touched on? Higher growth expectations - bigger cash flows being further in the future: That might explain why Snowflake's Stock Price took a larger hit than PLTR with the rising treasury yields.

Let's talk about the current valuation based on the Price to Sales Ratio - Consider the recently IPO'd companies (Datadog, DynaTrace, Palantir and Snowflake) - forget about SolarWinds for a second.

They all have P/S Ratios between 21 and 105 (Snowflake lul). My point being: PLTR is not grossly overvalued, they'll grow into that valuation. If all goes according to plan and assuming the market cap stays constant, which obv it won't - PLTR will have a P/S Ratio of under 20 with the current valuation. Close to Adobe with a P/S ratio of 16.85.

*SolarWinds is at a P/S ratio of 5, that's partly due to them being hacked which pretty much a.) fucked their growth in FY 2020 and for the following years and b.) people dumping their stock after the hacks were medialised (Share price of 25$ on December 11th - down to 14$ December 18th).*

To get back to the profitability part real quick, after that you're dismissed - Datadog, Dynatrace and Snowflake - the new kids on the block - all reported a negative Net Income for 2020 and they've all been around for at least a decade. (Snowflake founded 2012 - soz) Amazon was founded 1994 and had their first \*reported\* profitable year in 2004 - a decade later, that's just how it goes in the software/digital services world apparently.

**Edit:** Soros Fund Management is expected to dump those shares whenever their lock-in expires - [George Soros raised ethical concerns regarding PLTR's modus operandi](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/george-soros-is-offloading-palantir-shares-due-to-business-practices.html). That's the same guy who shorted the Thai Baht and the GBP - literally screwing over entire economies - raising ethical concerns about his little 400M$ position in PLTR (Sure dude, nice PR stunt). Them being invested in PLTR since 2012 however shows that they do see some deep value.

**TLDR**: So all that being said - Whilst PLTR is getting a lot of attention in the media and on various other platforms including this subreddit - I personally do not think that PLTR is grossly overvalued. There's some asset inflation due to macroeconomic factors but considering how hot of a topic of discussion PLTR is right now (as compared to Datadog for example), it surprised me that they're not at a higher P/S (example Snowflake P/S 105). Their growth potential is huge but not irrealistic, it seems like they have the scalability figured out. From a purely operational PoV Palantir is profitable, the expenses that make it unprofitable on paper have nothing to do with their product/services, it's just some financial shenanigans - Adjusted Net Profit was positive in FY 2020 and is expected to increase by 66% during FY 2021.

If the economy doesn't come crashing down in the foreseeable future, this stonk will imo be worth a whole lot more than it is right now. Let's hope that Yellen has some positive fiscal policy news for us today.

Treasury yields are decreasing (1.65% today vs. 1.75% on the 10 YR Treasury Notes a week ago - they might also continue rising). We have a potential catalyst on the 14th of April (Demo Day), quarterly earnings some time in May, so if the macroeconomic factors are with us, we might see a ""recovery"" from the current price levels shortly. In the longer run we'll just have to hope that the economy doesn't come crashing down. Goldman says we're not currently in a bubble, here's a nice read on that topic: [Goldman Sachs Says Global Stock Markets Are Nowhere Near Risky Bubble - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/goldman-says-global-stock-markets-are-nowhere-near-risky-bubble), make your own opinion.

I'll post it again - I really liked u/ada_diamonds take [Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, & Submersibility + My Lockup Plan : PLTR (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lknie3/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/) \- I can't tell you why PLTR is different from the other suppliers like he can (Predictive analytics, incomplete datasets something something) so go check that DD out if you haven't already. He also highlights where that future growth will potentially be coming from - more of a qualitative approach which I'm trying to support with some quants.

125,$SIRI: the other satellite company that could (beat the short sellers),32,mbhg31,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhg31/siri_the_other_satellite_company_that_could_beat/,31,"Since apparently you all consider each other financial advisors, I guess I need to tell you, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Hello and welcome to my DD for Sirius XM **($SIRI**), not to be confused with Apple's benevolent AI assistant. This is actually my first DD for you all, I hope you enjoy it. Sirius XM owns their satellite radio company and network, which is **factory installed in about 75% of new American cars**, and they **purchased Pandora in December 2019**, which was the largest internet radio company, whose only real competition is Spotify. I believe the company hasn't fully captured the gains from Pandora's acquisition, and it's in a perfect position to explode with smarter, connected vehicles becoming the norm. Pandora has by far the best learning algorithm to customize stations, and it's primed for some big deals, like the one it just signed with T-Mobile. This stock looks to me to be a fantastic pick, and here's some facts for you all:

1. The **float is 930M-960M shares**, and the short interest has hovered around 160M-200M shares for the past few years (20% of the float). **I know WSB loves to know about short interest, and that's damn high.**
2. Fundamentals are a dirty word here too, but this stock has pretty great fundamentals. **It's got a 25-35 P/E**, which is both low for a value stock, and low for a growth stock. 45 would be a conservative P/E for a company of this type, while a growth-focused company like Spotify has a -77 P/E ratio and **TSLA has a 1300+ P/E ratio**. Price tripling or quadrupling wouldn't be too difficult to stomach for the market, and that's not even what will happen if this goes to its rightful place in the **stars**.

2a. Still fundamental, **SIRI is actually profitable**, and managed to turn a profit even in the driving hell year of 2020. Almost every market caller has this ranked as being at least a $7-$8 stock, and they don't believe in the squeeze. **If this hits $10, that basically breaks open the option chain, and the market makers and hedges will have to scramble to hedge the stock properly.**

3. The stock is consistently trading in medium-high volumes (though nowhere near the short interest volume), meaning it's ready to move. For a stock with such high volume, **it's clearly only short interest holding the price down**. If market sentiment turns from neutral to bullish, this thing is going to take off.

4. **With low IV in the current option chain, nobody sees this coming. The buy-in on LEAPS is still cheap, and the upside is huge.** This stock looks like a no brainer, easily gonna go up in both the short term and long term, and potential to go way, way over the moon.

If you need positions, I own 500 shares and 50 LEAPS on this stock. **My short term price target is $9 by summer 2021, and $19 by summer 2022. Buy LEAPS on this, buy some shares, and print your own tickets.**

edit: The catalyst, since it's been asked, is that they merged with Pandora just before the pandemic hit and destroyed the economy. The purchase of another major company never even moved the needle, and there's pent up growth to realize as soon as things reopen, advertising starts to pick up again, and people start buying things. Spotify is their big competition right now, and Spotify is hemorrhaging money, that means there's gonna be a reckoning.",2021-03-23 23:38:19

I'm sure a lot of you have seen me post most of this in the daily threads, but it would be nice to get this some real visibility ahead of Tuesday:

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last big news catalysts?

``````New Edit 3/23``````

**3/23** - Breaking news this morning, [SEC filings indicate](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-21-090320) that Gamestop Chief Customer officer Frank Hamlin is stepping down after a transition ending 31 March. Who could possibly replace him? How about Kelli Durkin, Chewy’s prior Vice President of Customer Service who was [brought on with Gamestop March 1 as Senior VP of Customer Care](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer). There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.

No known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

*4* day action around that announcement (edited to include the 25th since the news dropped post-market on the 23rd):

02/25/2021 Open: $169.56 Close: $108.73 Vol: **150,308,800**

02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: **83,111,740**

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020


**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/01 - Close: $120.40

3/02 - Close: $118.18

3/03 - Close: $124.18

3/04 - Close: $132.35

3/05 - Close: $137.74

3/08 - Close: $194.50 - **Committee announcement pre-market**

3/09 - Close: $246.90

3/10 - Close: $265.00 - **Day's high: $348.5 - flash crash attempt**

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

**Editing to include some new info I dug up regarding the board members who will not be standing for re-election at the next board meeting.

An interesting find for anyone wondering about outgoing Gamestop board members who may own a large number of shares:

>**Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck** [told the board they don’t plan to stand for reelection](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-will-add-activist-investors-to-the-board-the-stock-shot-up-51610384385) at the company’s annual meeting in June. The board will shrink to nine members following that meeting.

Per [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-insiders-sold-stock-before-it-went-vertical-51611760507) three of the four members **sold a large % of their personal stake in Gamestop around January 13.** 

>GameStop Chair Kathy Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $1.4 million, a per-share average price of $27.99. Vrabeck, a senior client partner in the consumer markets division of Korn Ferry, now owns 79,537 GameStop shares. A director since June 2012, Vrabeck last sold stock in September 2015, selling 5,000 shares for $209,800, an average price of $41.96 each.

>Raul Fernandez sold 38,119 shares from Jan. 13 through 15 for a total of $1.4 million, a per-share average of $35.50. Fernandez is a vice chairman and owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, a private partnership that co-owns the NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals. He now owns 29,289 GameStop shares. It is the first stock sale for Fernandez, who joined GameStop’s board in April 2019.

>Lizabeth Dunn sold 5,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $156,700, a per-share average price of $31.34. Dunn, founder and CEO of Pro4ma, an IT services consulting firm, now owns 57,258 GameStop shares. She joined the board in April 2019, and this is her first sale of stock.",2021-03-22 20:01:05

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayfta/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/mb100z/elliot_wave_theory_an_introduction_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I have literally spent my entire day since market closed writing these posts so I hope they are useful to somebody. The 1st part introduced Impulse waves rules and guidelines. The 2nd part covered Diagonals and the first corrective waves - zigzags. I also included some examples of actual charts, rather than the simple drawings in the first post. If you have not read part 1 or 2 yet, please do before reading this. I would advise everyone to save each part and read them over again as they learn.

Anyway, here goes.

**Corrective waves**

*Contracting Triangles:*

Rules:

* A triangle always subdivides into five waves
* At least four waves among waves A, B, C, D and E each subdivide into a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave C never moves beyond the end of wave A, wave D never moves beyond the end of wave B, and wave E never moves beyond the end of C. The result is that, going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D converges with a line connecting the ends of waves A and C (forming a triangle)
* A triangle never has more than one complex subwave, in which case it is always a zigzag combination or a triangle.

Guidelines:

* Usually, wave C subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes, wave D subdivides into a zigzag combination that is longer lasting and contains deeper percentage retracements than each of the other subwaves
* Sometimes one of the waves, usually wave C, D, or E, subdivides into a contracting or barrier triangle. Often the effect is as if the entire triangle consisted of nine zigzags
* About 60% of the time, wave B does not end beyond the start of wave A. When it does, the triangle is called a running triangle

*Barrier Triangle*

* A barrier triangle has the same characteristics as a contracting triangle except that waves B and D end at essentially the same level
* When wave 5 follows a triangle, it is typically either a brief, rapid movement or an exceptionally long extension

&#x200B;

*Expanding Triangle*

Rules:

Most rules are the same as for contracting triangles, with these differences:

* Wave C, D, and E each moves beyond the end of the preceding semi-directional subwave (The result is that going forward in time, a line connecting the ends of waves B and D diverges from a line connecting the ends of waves A and C)
* Subwaves B, C and D each retrace at least 100% but no more than 150% of the preceding subwave

&#x200B;

Guidelines:

Most guidelines are the same as well, with these differences:

* Subwaves B, C and D usually retrace 105 to 125% of the preceding subwave
* No subwave has yet been observed to subdivide into a triangle

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Triangles are probably my favourite setup to trade](https://preview.redd.it/spe2jfdtioo61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=700771d35c77fe6c960367bfb9e6570480143673)

[A triangle setup I identified a few weeks ago](https://preview.redd.it/ktfa7u0vioo61.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cdf556c2dc50b97904005704e810640caac799a)

*Combinations*

Rules:

* Combinations comprise two or three corrective patterns seperated by one or two corrective patterns in the opposite direction, labeled as X (The first corrective pattern is labeled W, the second Y and the third, if there is one, Z)
* A zigzag combination comprises two or three zigzags (in which case it is called a double or triple zigzag)
* A ""double three"" flat combination comprises (in order) a zigzag and a flat, a flat and a zigzag, a flat and a flat, a zigzag and a triangle or a flat and a triangle
* A rare ""triple three"" flat combination comprises three flats
* Double and triple zigzags take the place of zigzags and double and triple threes take the place of flats and triangles
* An expanding triangle has yet to be observed as a component of a combination

Guidelines:

* When a zigzag or flat appears too small to be the entire wave with respect to the preceding wave (or if it is to be wave 4, the preceding wave 2) a combination is likely.

**General Advice For Using Elliot Waves**

* The best approach is deductive reasoning. By knowing what Elliot rules will not allow, you can deduce that whatever remains is the proper perspective
* Have a preferred count and an alternative count - Its important not to be biased when trading!
* Always invest with the preferred count - until proven wrong!

&#x200B;

I just want to leave this last note as well:

The trick to trading is to notice that it is all just waves within waves. Patterns within patterns. Whether it is on the 1 minute time frame, the 1 hour, or the 1 month. The patterns are the same, just of different amplitudes. The bigger the time frame, the more important the pattern. The same could be said of life really. Shit happens, but its only one event in the grand scheme of things. Zoom out if you need to. And if that doesn't help - Zoom out again.

I like seeing people make those sweet sweet gains and tendies galore. So I decided to make this post to help you autists sharpen your crayons and actually use them for a greater purpose than just as snacks to eat in between buying calls on whatever stock is hot for the day.

Elliot Waves are a theory that markets move in stages of a theoretical ""2 steps forward, one step back"" type movement (in this case 5 advances with 3 pullbacks, usually followed by 2 declines with 1 advance). They were first observed and described in the mid 1900's. For more background info, and a full description of Elliot waves, their history and uses, and applications, I would advise everyone to read ""Elliot wave Principles: Key to market behaviour"" by A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter. You can access this for free at [https://z-lib.org/](https://z-lib.org/)

&#x200B;

This post will outline a summary of Rules and Guidelines for Elliot Waves:

**Motive Waves**

*Impulse:*

Rules:

* An impulse wave always subdivides into 5 waves
* Wave 1 always subdivides into an impulse or (rarely) a diagonal
* Wave 3 always subdivides into an impulse
* Wave 5 always divides into an impulse or diagonal
* Wave 2 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat or combination
* Wave 4 always subdivides into a zigzag, flat, triangle or combination
* Wave 2 never moves beyond the start of wave 1
* Wave 3 always moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Wave 3 is never the shortest wave
* Wave 4 never moves beyond the end of wave 1
* Never are waves 1, 3 and 5 all extended

Guidelines:

* Wave 4 will almost always be a different corrective pattern than wave 2
* Wave 2 is usually a zigzag or zigzag combination
* Wave 4 is usually a flat, triangle or flat combination
* Sometimes wave 5 does not move beyond the end of wave 3 (in which case it is called a truncation)
* Wave 5 often ends when meeting or slightly exceeding a line drawn from the end of wave 3 that is parallel to the line connecting the ends of waves 2 and 4
* The centre of wave 3 almost always has the steepest slope of any equal period within the parent impulse except that sometimes an early portion of wave 1 (the kickoff) will be steeper
* Wave 1, 3, or 5 is usually extended (an extension appears ""stretched"" because its corrective waves are small compared to its impulse waves. It is substantially longer and contains larger sub-divisions than the non-extended waves
* Often the extended subwave is the same number (1, 3 or 5) as the parent wave
* Rarely do two subwaves extend, although it is typical for waves 3 and 5 both to extend when they are of Cycle or Supercycle degree and within a fifth wave of one degree higher
* Wave 1 is the least commonly extended wave
* When wave 3 is extended, waves 1 and 5 tend to have gains related by equality or the Fibonnaci ratio
* When wave 5 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 1through 3
* When wave 1 is extended, it is often in Fibonnaci proportion to the net travel of waves 3 through 5
* Wave 4 typically ends when it is within the price range of subwave four of 3
* Wave 4 often subdivides the entire impulse into Fibonnaci proportions in time and/or price

&#x200B;

It seems after the comparisons, in terms of PFOF fees relative to costs, Chase and Merrill Lynch might be the best brokerage. As for how fast Chase orders are, I could not find any information. For those with more money, IBKR Pro seems to make sense especially with really low margin rates.

I assume the brokerages that posted their execution speeds are ones that are confident they are far above average.

Also, do keep in mind there's also stuffs like price improvement, execution price, effective spread, etc. to take into account. I just wanted to sum up some of the brokerages.

I use Fidelity as my main brokerage and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Fidelity #1. Everything so good :3.

What are your thoughts/recommendations on which brokerage to use?",2021-03-23 07:50:04
142,$UWMC: The Trinity play of 2021 Value/Gamma/Float! When the Squozes keep on squoozing...,583,mavc3b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mavc3b/uwmc_the_trinity_play_of_2021_valuegammafloat/,233,"**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an  entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB with a  bias due to having a large position in $UWMC. So, proceed on your own  risk... and don't act on anything written here.**

**- If you are here for an option play, this is the wrong place. You will most probably get burned.**

Hello fellow Ape! Don't be shy come closer 🍌 Today I'll introduce to you the Trinity play of the Moon 2021! So buckle up ape and wear your space suit 👨‍🚀

[$UWMC Trinity](https://preview.redd.it/pl1qqwt3omo61.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=b154b0f1151688de79c331aac577dfd9d1848a98)

1- $UWMC has a float of approximately 90.23 Million(Market Watch). In ape language, there is a relatively a small amount of stocks available on the market for fellow apes to buy. **This makes the stock very volatile and able to easily moon** if a lot of Apes buy it. In addition and more importantly, When enzinga asked Matt Ishba(CEO) if he would do an offering(offer more stocks to the float which would decrease it) he responded with ""I'm much more of a long-term holder of the business than a seller."" \~ SO NO!!!

I dare you to find any other stock with same float and potential!

2- $UWMC has a massive Gamma squeeze potential if it reaches 10$+ and stays over. The open interest is insane and to put that into perspective, there are 91,835 Calls(I'm only counting the upcoming 2 dates April and May with strikes up to 15$)\~ **worth 9,183,500 shares which equals Approx 10% of FLOAT if they get exercised!!!** Can you comprehend how insane is that? and I didn't even count all the calls... These are only for the 2 upcoming dates.

Bellow is the most recent Call Option Chain (I used Crayons to better illustrate):

[Option Chain April](https://preview.redd.it/vf4kof6aomo61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c46ed9d9cdae14e4a1c52e1e4aa5bcdde167e9)

[Option Chain May](https://preview.redd.it/vyv4s7ccomo61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ede5f7729a4cf909acfb6a11cdbfea0f96c6d92)

3- Now for the short squeeze potential, This month's short interest hasn't been out yet, but we can try to approximate it by taking a look at the short volume. For the past 5 Business days, **$UWMC had a short volume with an average of 24.288 and on Thursday it was 32.09(Fintel)!!** To put that into perspective, $AMC, a heavily shorted stock, had an average short volume of only 15.24 for the past 5 business days(Fintel). **With this low float and high short volume, this could be a Mars shot passing the Moon...**

[Short Volume](https://preview.redd.it/mt6wenfgomo61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f33dd04302d321a993a227c1a4bc45ec4868b01)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\- Even without the trinity, $UWMC is still an undervalued stock. It has a fair value of 19.68$ on SWS!! I could go into details about how it's undervalued, but I'm not going to do that today. You can Look at other DD's on WSB.

\- By now, $UWMC is all over WSB and in my opinion it's only a matter of time until it moons in a one shot to the moon.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the most important part

What this stock really needs is exposure. If you believe in it and think it’s undervalued, **you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure.** **Every post matters!!** If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the  Moon(soon)!! **I hope it trends on StockTwits one day because ST is a market mover in my opinion.**

**I wouldn't buy any call options anymore because they will not only not push the stock upwards, but  they also have a very high risk of expiring worthless!**

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic.

They have also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold.

Market makers have hiked up the IV.  Which means you can only buy 2/3rds the amount of calls vs flat skew; thus reducing your ability to cause a gamma squeeze.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cg3cauvf2mo61.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5eb3f4b19fddb2e4afae0f665c18036f259c344

Additional detail:

Skew is term to describe IV of Out-of-the-money strikes vs at-the-money.  Typically you will either see flat skew (all strikes similar IV), or skew in the lower strikes (higher IV).  Sometimes you will see negative skew (lower IV) in higher strikes.

\[Note: I am simply going to say lower or higher strikes rather than calls / puts, since they are synthetically the same depending on how much stock you have.  So for you all you noobs, a 1:1 covered call is synthetically the same as being short the same strike put\]

This is primarily due to supply/demand.  Since nearly everyone is net long, when they get scared they might either paper-hand their longs, or buy lower strike puts.  When their stocks are going up, they might sell higher strike calls (covered calls).  

But for GME the IV is much higher for the higher strikes.  This could be because:

* Too much demand, either a) apes going bananas or b) people who want to get front-spread (short at the money gamma) needing to buy out the money protection so that they can show their risk manager they don't have unlimited risk.
* Not enough supply, because no one is going to sell OTM calls since they fear the Planet of the Apes.
* Price-gouging: because they know the apes are price-insensitive and need their heroine fix, so just jack up the prices, and the apes won't even know it.  

Do whatever you want, I am rooting for the ape army.  But just be aware that creating a gamma squeeze is harder with the jacked up skew.",2021-03-23 01:20:07

Do me a favor, go look at what happened when AT&T was trust busted in 1982. Do a little reading. This sentimwnt of anti-trust is only heating up in recent times. If Facebook were to be busted apart, all those companies would become independent companies again and likely trade under their own new ticker.

162,Big Catalyst tomorrow for RKT!,285,maubsk,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big_catalyst_tomorrow_for_rkt/,187,"Tomorrow's a big day for RKT!

At this point, it's painfully clear that the stock price is being artificially kept down. Shares available to borrow dropped from **6,700,000** last Tuesday to **200,000** today.

Let's do some quick maths:

Tomorrow all shareholders get a special dividend of $1.11 per share.

With a Public Float of 108.45 mm shares and 39.66 mm shares shorted (as of Feb 26 per Yahoo)

No we all know a dividend of $1.11 isn't going to scare shorts off. But what I believe will catch them off guard is the Re-Investment of those dividends.

If EVERYONE re-invests the dividend, that's:

(108.45mm+39.66mm) \* 1.11 = **$164,402,100**

$164,402,100 / $23.89 (Current Max Pain Price) = **6,881,628** shares of buying power! There are only **200,000** share left to borrow.

This could make the stock go **PARABOLIC**

# But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...

YES YOU DO. Why? Because think about who the retail investors who would be paying attention if/when it goes parabolic. These retail are Millennials and Gen Z. That means they are looking for their first car loans or first home loans! They are College Students and Grad Students, Engineers/ people passionate about creating change. Not only are they the exact demographic that would be Rocket consumers, they are also the exact demographic that Dan Gilbert wants to recruit to Detroit to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon!

Take me for example, I'm 32 and looking to buy my first home soon. I was planning to go the traditional route, talk to some banks... blah blah blah. After seeing RKT and reading about Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner, I'll most likely end up using Rocket! Now take me and times that by millions around the world!

By ""sacrificing"" your dividend (by buying into an undervalued stock... poor you), you would be boosting the value of the rest of your investment by improving the very fundamentals of the company itself. It's a no brainer!

# Don't most people take the dividend as cash?

Under normal circumstances at a mature company, yes, people take the cash because the company has nothing else to do with the money. This, however, is a **special** dividend. RKT is nowhere near done growing. In fact, they went public in order TO grow. They didn't do it for the cash. This is from an article from when they first went public.

[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)

>*Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It closed $145 billion in loans in 2019 and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion. Gilbert founded the company in 1985. In 2010, he moved its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. The company employs some 20,000 across the country with most based in Detroit.*  
>  
>***While Quicken's coffers do not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said, going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.***  
>  
>***""That’s a lot easier to do when you’re a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and software people.""***

Dan Gilbert is trying to build the next Amazon... they only STARTED!!

This dividend was given out to bust the shorts. I'm sure many thought that the ANNOUCEMENT was to bust shorts....no... it's the **Re-Investment** that will bust shorts.

The Play : Don't just buy options. That doesn't help, you just end up handing the MMs money. If you're not in this already, it should be a 60/40 split on Shares/ Options Or something like that. Obviously since the event is tomorrow, I bought a bunch of weekly options (not a lot compared to my overall investment in RKT), but I can't in good conscious recommend that to anyone, weeklies are just straight gambling. Buy shares! I'm not sure when the best options play would be since I'm not sure when the next catalyst would be, there's a buyback looming, could be anytime.

Positions- 24k shares and calls splattered throughout the options chain. GL!

169,AMRS,55,mb2mjb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb2mjb/amrs/,123,"Hey guys I just wanted to share with you a company that I think can be a 10x stock in less than 5 years. The ticker is AMRS.

Amyris is a biotech company that has figured out a way to bioengineer the DNA of yeast bacteria in order to produce any naturally occurring molecule found in nature. Normally yeast consumes sugar to produce ethanol, but Amyris has found a way to feed the yeast sugar cane and produce any molecule they want. Not only can they produce any molecule they want, but they can scale the molecules to commercial 200,000 liter fermentation tanks. Ok cool, so they can make molecules, big deal, what does this actually mean? Well this is where it gets interesting. These molecules that they are creating, are disrupting and replacing traditional molecules that are harvested from plants or produced from fossil fuels. Some of these ingredients include, Reb M, (replacing sugar and stevia), Vanillin (replacing vanilla flavor), Squalane (replacing Squalane which is used in lotions/skin care products), CBG (replacing CBD because it is more effective). This is just a few in the 18 molecules they have in the current pipeline.

Ok cool, so they can replace traditional molecules/ingredients, big deal? But thing is, it IS a big deal. Amyris is able to replace these traditional molecules because they are able to do it at a cheaper cost because they use sugar cane waste from sugar cane plantations, they are able to do it at large commercial scale, and they are able to produce the molecules even purer than traditional means.

 This industry is in its infancy still but bioengineering bacteria hosts to produce chemistry is the future of the materials industry, especially as resources become more scarce and demand for sustainable ingredients/molecules increase. The company currently produces 3-4 molecules each year at scale (industrial fermentation tanks) and has 12 molecules currently being produced and sold. Not to mention (450) molecules in the pipeline ready to take to market when the time is right.
 
What they are doing is extremely smart right now. They are creating their own consumer brands and using the ingredients that they bioengineer to sell to the consumer for super high markup. They are able to make 50-60% gross profit margin on these products... This is an insane amount of profit on sale.. They already have 3 consumer brands and are launching 5 more this year. They plan to get each brand to a billion dollar valuated company...

Now, here is where it gets interesting. They are using the profits from the consumer brand sales to fund the growth into the ingredient sales business... This is huge because this will allow them to build more manufacturing facilities to be able to produce more chemicals for more companies willing to sell them. These other companies have to pay Amyris for the ingredients out right, pay them royalties, OR license out the molecules (kind of like a software license). It's kind of like how tesla started. They started with extremely expensive electric sports car, had to sell a bunch of these at a high markup so they could afford to grow and build mass market vehicles for the everyday person.

Oh yeah and did I mention that Amyris is the only one of it's biotech peers that will be profitable this year and be able to self fund all of it's growth going forward?

This company is disrupting the chemical materials industry and IS THE FUTURE of the synthetic biology industrial revolution.

If you want to learn more about this company there are a few great videos that explain what the company is doing. The analyst, Graham Tanaka has some videos of the interview with the CEO and the VP of R&D here:

170,The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on Volkswagen,1228,maiolz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maiolz/the_arbitrage_michael_burry_trade_on_volkswagen/,289,"Michael Burry said **“I don’t own a Porsche, but I own the Porsche that owns VW that owns Porsche”**. Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.

**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**

* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.
* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% 
* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)
* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE’s current market-cap.
* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. 
* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.
* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn’t fixed.
* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.

Volkswagen recently had their own type of ""battery day"" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. 

TLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven’t blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you’re down, that’s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we’ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It’s like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It’s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it’ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don’t worry. Basics are super simple and I won’t confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you’re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I’m sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we’re going to cover today.

You’re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda

Let’s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We’re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it’s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we’re going to add to our chart what’s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. 🤯

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There’s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we’re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that’s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here’s the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. “If I were to hold two more days, I could’ve doubled my money”.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it’s close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would’ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don’t look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I’m not touching TSLA. I’m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That’s gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, “Shit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?”

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It’s a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

https://biotechradar.eu/summary-of-the-covid-19-vaccine-supply-agreements-for-europe-incl-the-uk-switzerland-the-us-and-japan/

Vaccine has done very well in phase 3 trials including 100% effectiveness against severe covid

https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/clinical-areas/immunology-and-vaccines/novavax-to-seek-regulatory-approval-as-vaccine-found-100-effective-against-severe-covid/?cmpredirect

Next step is to get approval from the regulators

Also holds licence agreements with poorer countries (no financial benefit just thought it was worth mentioning)

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/cdsco-panel-allows-serum-institute-of-india-to-conduct-bridge-trial-of-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-6660201.html

So all looks good for Novavax plus the UK has seen a slow down in distribution of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine putting the program back by 4 weeks

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56438629

In the UK the chancellor just announced the budget which was very favourable to the area of Teesside, which is where Novavax is based in the UK

https://www.business-live.co.uk/economic-development/tees-valley-emerges-big-winner-19957435

So I'm all for Novavax and while they have had their recent spike and dropped back down, once they get approval it would seem they're golden for the foreseeable future.

But wait!

Etoro research section reports that 

Gary Evans Novavax company director made an informative sale of his shares of $5,174,536 on 17/3/21 and Gregory Glenn Novavax President made an uniformative sale of his shares on the same day for $2,185,696 
(I cant link this as you'd need an account but its in the research section of Novavax)

Given share price on the day and the amount of shares held according to this link
 
https://gb.wallmine.com/people/17216/gary-c-evans#complete-history

It means that Gary Evans sold more than 50% of his shares in the company on the 17th of March. 

That to me seems to suggest a big red warning flag and perhaps he knows theres some sort of delay / problem in terms of getting the vaccine approved? The share rates were higher in the weeks prior and if my company was about to complete on all those contracts I would assume it would be a good time to HOLD not bail out before the announcement.

On the grapevine I have heard that a company who supplies an ingredient for the vaccine has been told to delay, but whether that is while they wait for approval or because they might not get approval, I have no idea.

So, thats my ""DD"", my question is, are those share sales as big of a red flag as I'm thinking they might be? Or do I remain bullish on Novavax.

Any thoughts?",2021-03-23 20:28:49

**Volume - catalysts**

I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:

https://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e

&#x200B;

Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase."" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:

https://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7

&#x200B;

The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like ""ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button""). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:

https://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189

https://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601

&#x200B;

So, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of ""the squeeze might happen here"" or ""the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming"" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.

**OBV**

""But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes."" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba

&#x200B;

So what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.

So, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.

**SPY and VIX**

Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):

Though the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.

**Support and resistance**

https://preview.redd.it/slo3fv3wrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f924e3df995fb61353f38129c591ccf86a835

&#x200B;

In this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.

**Current patterns**

Looking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:

https://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da

&#x200B;

As you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26

&#x200B;

That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42

As you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/z0fiv5g1sfo61.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90c277e9796d2d5485c1633a522c18d7d85cdae

**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**

Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e

The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:

https://preview.redd.it/i1bonxi3sfo61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0067ba6738df71b367ff56765f3fbb6de790e53

These three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.

**A note about the ""short attacks""**

As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**

The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**A Note about squeezes**

Before I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.

**Why short interest might not matter**

If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.

**FTD Squeeze**

I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.

**Closing Thots**

In short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account. I have always loved investing and trading, but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy.

Well, here's a quick explanation and what to look out for this week.

*What does yields have to do with it?*  Yields, or most likely what it's referencing (the 10 year yield on US Treasuries) is the risk-free rate. Basically if you buy a 10 year treasury for $90 and hold it until maturity, you get a 1.11% annual yield. You absolutely can't go tits up with this unless you bought a North Korean or Turkish Bonds.

In this case, it becomes the price of money. No one is willing to go lower than the 1.11% yield unless they hate money. For mortgages, loans and all sorts of businesses, this is the theoretically cheapest anyone can borrow, since no one has better credit or liquidity as the US government.

In the case of tech stocks, some boomer back in the day decided to value stocks (which provide dividends) as a perpetual bond. The formula for that is P = Coupon/Risk Free Rate. Tech stocks are especially sensitive to this, since the Coupon (returning earnings to shareholders, but you can argue buybacks should be this) is basically 0. Say if $100 = $1/1% is the current ""boomer valuation."" If yields go up only 1% (which isn't that out of place), technically the stock price is supposed to be cut in half.

This is also why valuation methods like this don't work for GME or fast growing companies. In any case, this is just a boilerplate valuation method.

*So what next?* The tantrum all started with the [Feb 2021 7-year auction](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2021/R_20210225_3.pdf) with a high yield of 1.195%. What's pesky about treasury auctions is that once the yield/price is set for the the newest issue (the on the run bond), all previous bonds of the same maturity drop in price/increase in yields as less people want it because it is less liquid.

[You can look at historical prices](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult_query.htm) yourself. Remember when you calculate yields with excel, you need to input the coupon values.

The next auctions are set for this [Thursday](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/instit.htm?upcoming), with a similar size of $62 billion on the 7yr and $61 billion on the 5yr. Why do these tenors matter? Apart from them having a certain amount of influence on the 10yr which drives the economy, they are also beyond JPOW's promise of no rate hikes until 2023. A pesky thing called duration exists in the bond market. Basically yield move\*duration=inverse move in prices. On zero-coupon and near-zero-coupon bonds like these, the duration is basically the maturity. This means on your new shiny 1.2% 7yr treasury, if in the near term rates go up 1%, you are expected to have a -7% change on the new price that you can sell on the market.

Many bond holders are expecting inflation (and Fed rate increases) to go up in the next few years, and thus are reluctant to buy now, dropping the price and increasing interest rates, which could set off an entire chain of yield re-pricings if JPOW doesn't get off his sorry ass and gets brrrrrrrring.

I expect rates to get hotter before we get YCC or some heavy purchases by the Fed. The Fed's actions with ending SLR (thus decreasing the amount of liquidity banks have on hand to do regular short term stuff like commercial paper) and JPOW's disastrously non-~~committal~~brrrrrr interview makes me think the Fed is allowing the market to do its job by tamping down on some exuberance. The first to get hit by hotter rates is absolutely tech. 

I have sold the bulk of my tech options and holdings. I currently just have some gold shorts down to $1685 by April.",2021-03-23 03:17:51

RC tweets seem to be tweeted as MACD histogram bars are rising, and RC tweets seem to be tweeted when there is general overbuying (W%R is medium-high). Also, RC tweets seem to usually come when there is a strong signal for an uptrend (+DI and ADX are both high).

Elon only tweeted once, but it was literally right before a giant spike in price. There are a few things that I find interesting about this tweet. Volume was very high leading up to the days of this tweet. The +DI to -DI divergence was very high the day before the tweet. Overbuying was very high (high W%R), and the MACD histogram bar doubled in the previous day.

Again, I don’t think we can assume causality from any of these tweets, but it is interesting to look at the technical signals leading up to or after a tweet.",2021-03-23 02:18:58
195,NAPA (Duckhorn Portfolio Inc) DD,47,mayn5g,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mayn5g/napa_duckhorn_portfolio_inc_dd/,40," (NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders. 

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley.  Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1) Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth. 

2) Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin. 

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue. 

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR. 

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to. 

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded. 

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million. 

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season. 

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

There is also earning call on 4/27.   Been in a long upward trend since getting hammered by COVID, as of now $8.88 stonk price and $9 calls are cheap.

THEN I STARTED READING STUFF ABOUT IT.

This is a slow moving stock, BUT has several catalysts that should easily make for some quick gains (not financial advice) to roll around in or re-invest in GME/AMC/etc.   This reminds me a bit of the short RKT saga, but I am not suggesting there will be a squeeze, just tendies.  

Catalysts:

\- Ex Dividend Date on 3/30, which means buying the stonk and holding to get dividend, or calls for THIS FRIDAY to play on the anticipated buying pressure of others getting in for dividend.   Dividend will then be paid out on 4/30.  This is a REIT with a 10.21 div yield, i.e. very high dividend all things relative, so not a bad place to park your money for a second.

\- Earnings call on 4/26

\- COVID impacts starting to waiver.  NLY is a mortgage REIT, the general consensus seems to be that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, i.e. stonks like this that got hammered are buy opportunities. 

\-Look at the 1 week chart and call prices.  Calls won't get you the dividend and of course are more risky, so buying the stock or playing the options are both viable depending on risk tolerance.

1. **The price of a number of other stocks that Melvin Capital held short positions in closely correlate with GME's. It's not just AMC/GME. (BBBY, IRBT, FIZZ and GSX)**
2. **Melvin Capital held put positions in these tickers but closed them during Q4 of 2020, before all of them went through a period of volatility along with GME.** 
3. **MC hold a put position in $AG, a silver mining company that was shilled on WSB during the 'silver squeeze' bullshit, which also followed a similiar pattern to GME in January with a rapid run-up around the 27th January.** 

Link to Melvin Capital 13F filings i.e. MC's holdings, use the 'quarter to view' drop-down to select which quarter to view. 

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)

From that you can view or download an excel file of MC's holdings - up to Q4 of 2020. 

Back at the end of January I was looking at the day's biggest movers on yahoo, and noticed that a few silver mining companies had gone up by around 20-25%.  This was at the time that all that bullshit about a 'silver squeeze' was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole 'silver squeeze' thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day's other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.

Like I say, what I did was go through that day's (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F's have been made available. I'll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4dyzatf3bgo61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fd1c05149cb9247ee2a442114e5bdd0bc5ef2b

As you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn't demonstrate causation however: the point I'm making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can't really be put down to just general market trends. 

Now, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.

**$BBBY**

[GME in orange, BBBY in Green. ](https://preview.redd.it/g11nca6cago61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=d23715bfefb01a62cc75f05da1ee870985b41f8b)

MC position as of Q3 13F:

PUT. Market value: $48,385,000. Also their 69th biggest holding. Nice. 

Another interesting thing about $BBBY is this:

[**https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693**](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693)

Cramer made a couple tweets about BBBY and linked them to WSB. Pretty sure there's one where he actually tried to driect WSB's attention to BBBY but I can't find it. 

&#x200B;

**$IRBT**

[$IRBT in blue GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/3zt6lrlwago61.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e5e0c62df6aefb1156dcb9f25c374542926c6c3)

MC held a $37,950,000 market value PUT according to 13F filings for Q3. 

**$GSX**

[GSX in purple GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/t6jgqm8obgo61.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=345c6d445d3dcb6f135f9b2b4345ae280bf6357c)

 MC held a $148,682,000 market value put position. 

**$FIZZ**

[FIZZ in yellow GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/3usgiedqbgo61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=3942d0fe1c72d4e186cbf942b0a994540499f6c1)

MC held a  $54,408,000 put position. 

**Finally, $AG**

https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0

Now, I can't find any AG position for MC in Q3, however for Q4, they added an entirely new position. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11

That's a brand new put position in the 4th quarter of 2020 worth $74m USD. If anyone has got the ticker mention data I think it would be really interesting to see the ticker mentions of things like $SLV and $AG around this period. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now to cover the Q3 vs Q4 filings, below are the Q4 statements for the previous tickers  that I stated MC held put positions in for Q3:

&#x200B;

[BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/ye0b1yt4pgo61.png?width=1767&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8bd937433f7fb72167ee77f06ea80317e82e72)

&#x200B;

[IRBT](https://preview.redd.it/bgtvsku5pgo61.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a944a913af5445e1562fa2803596a5ca636f864)

&#x200B;

[GSX](https://preview.redd.it/f7cawpk6pgo61.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d7cd66c5ba768d23a2d1cd1af6be5ecc328e403)

&#x200B;

[FIZZ](https://preview.redd.it/tfix9lvcpgo61.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0275f1e13fc50a76970bc1e598ea1b3453562c2)

So there was a correlation between GME and a number of other stocks that MC held short positions in as of Q3 of 2020, but they abruptly closed these positions out in Q4, before the volatility early in Q1 of 2021. 

**So to summarise:** 

1. There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their **Q3** 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. 
2. According to Melvin Capital's  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions *before* the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. 
3. MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it's peak. The consensus at the time was that the 'silver squeeze' was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. 

There are probably other tickers that could fit here that I've missed too. 

**So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?**

Could MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? 

Once the Q1 2020 13F's are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it's up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there's something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward. After all, if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters eventually they'll write some Shakespeare.",2021-03-22 07:38:02

$GME -25% 3/19 EOW

# Rambling OPINION PIECE, skip if you just want the calculator

It's been two weeks with over 70% correlation between gamma and price. Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for 🦍🦍🦍 to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.

Some important points

1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.
2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.
3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.
4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\_was\_the\_footprint\_of\_institutional\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)
5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.
6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate

I believe if 🦍🦍🦍 understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   🍌 to it, 🦍🦍🦍 together  💪 , 🦍🦍🦍 + 🧠 = mega  🍌🍌 🍌

# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8

This update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders

The calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include

* Current Price
* Projected Price
* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)
* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)
* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date

The new graph simulator graph has the following controls

https://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e

That allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a

From the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while 🌈🐻 buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.

By clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price

https://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571

From the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.

To find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge

https://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a

To find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest

https://preview.redd.it/yb8j1jdu8ho61.jpg?width=1315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6495f3c8ea70a1a543a62a3d03bcda5cd75b3d8

You can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).

To model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.

https://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448

change the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067

https://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4

You'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.

On the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.

https://preview.redd.it/r74sn5ud9ho61.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae17addc9f5cf1d9c1dac73343fbb2847524f00

Gamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV

# Obligatory harebrained scheme

If all 🦍🦍🦍 understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.

*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling 🦍🦍🦍 to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if 🦍 did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*

For this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  💎🤲 , I suggest 🦍🦍🦍 wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, 🦍🦍🦍 can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.

Summarizing, the steps are

1. 💎🤲  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week
2. Wait for IV <200%
3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio
4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting 🍌🍌🍌s. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *🦍🦍🦍* together or the play won't work
5. Watch price goes up end of week
6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain
7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes
8. Witness short hedgies cry
9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse
10. Profit !!!

The company released earnings last week and beat expectations by 250% and increased their guidance for this year. Stock is up +215% from the recent low on March 5. Stock IPO'd in December, insiders are locked up for 6 months, and float is 44.6M shares (relatively low). Since beating earnings, on the very next day, all available shares for shorting have been shorted. Guys, the shortsellers are trying to keep this company from succeeding! That means they're against us in getting better access to credit and lower interest rates.

UPST, founded by ex-Google employees, uses AI/ML and alternative data e.g. college degree, geographic, employment history, payment history, job type, etc. basically everything else that can attest to your character and credit worthiness outside of a simple FICO score to create a smarter risk assessment on you and have the banks loan you money and lower interest rates.

>In a 2018 study, Upstart demonstrated to several large U.S. banks that our AI-based lending platform could almost triple their approval rates while holding losses constant compared to their current risk models.  
>  
>\-CEO, David Girouard (4Q2020 Earnings Call on March 5, 2021).

In other words, by using UPST's smarter credit models, the banks are able to lend out 3X more money without taking on increased risk/exposure on each loan. While FICO scores can be negatively impacted by one or two adverse events, UPST will look beyond what FICO sees to gauge your trustworthiness. Getting screwed by medical bills/insurance will destroy your FICO, but UPST could help the banks see past that and understand you have a solid job, payment history, degree, assets, etc. and get you the credit you need at the fair interest rate you should be getting, counter to what FICO suggests.

The company also announced on the earnings call of their acquisition of Prodigy Software to enter into the auto lending market. Want a better rate for your next car purchase and not get screwed by FICO? Upstart is making this happen.

This is the future...it's an amazing company/story/stock and a no-brainer opportunity. Squeeze the short sellers and decrease business' dependency on FICO scores for the betterment of society.

Description/Catalyst

Paramount Resources is one of the oldest publicly-traded oil and gas companies with over 2 million net acres of land in Canada. The stock is trading at multi-year lows, and I believe has an expected return of between 200% and 300% in the next year. The most important catalyst should happen very soon: growth in Q2/19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta. Given the age of the company (IPO in 1978), legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields, and requires much less capital to sustain. With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti, Paramount’s production should increase after a year of declining. To oversimplify: oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected. With Paramount’s stock near 20-year lows, and production about to start growing after a year of declining, the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of \~$20/share. I believe downside is limited (outside of macro oil price shocks), given how low expectations are. 

Business Description:

Paramount has production from three regions, but for simplicity’s sake, only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case. The three regions are: Grand Prairie (where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside), Kaybob Region (will likely decline 15-20% per year) and Central Alberta (will likely decline 10-15% per year). The most important region is Grand Prairie, which is currently 1/3rd of production, and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions. Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months, making them amongst the top oil wells in North America. Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results. The Wapiti region, which is right next door to Karr, just had their first wells turn online in April/May when Keyera’s gas processing facility came online. The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti. 

History and Why the Stock is Mispriced

Today’s investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years. In 2017, Paramount bought Apache’s assets in Canada. The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta; however, production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid-2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region. This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth. Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd. However, actual production came in at 86kboepd. Paramount’s stock fell, as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced.

The bear thesis on POU is simple: production went from 95kboepd in Q4/17 to 85kboepd in Q4/18 despite $600m of capex and management’s initial promise of 100kboped of production. Bears don’t believe management’s new 2019 guidance for growth to 85-90kboepd in Q4/19 with only $350m of capex. These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20-year lows today. 

The bridge from 95kbodp in Q4/17 to 85kboepd Q4/18 is as follows:

* 5kboepd less from an asset sale (Resthaven land)
* \~5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land (exploration region that didn’t work – guidance should have been set more conservatively).
* \~5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues. 

Expectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low. I believe Paramount’s production will exit at nearly 100mboepd (guidance is for 85-90). My simple math is as follows:

Karr:

* Q4/18 production was \~27kboepd. This has been their best asset recently, and production was kept flat in 2018 (exit to exit) because of midstream constraints. The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H/18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd. 

Wapiti:

* The company had zero production here in Q4/18, but began turning online wells in May/April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online. The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year, and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd. If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year. These wells start off at much higher rates initially, and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately. I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing \~20kboepd

Kaybob region:

* This is a mature old field with a \~20% decline rate. The company is drilling a few new wells here, and I think production will decline 5% from Q4/18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4/19

Central Alberta:

* This is another mature old and gas field with a \~15% decline rate. I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4/18 to 17kboepd in Q4/19. 

Summary Q4/19 estimate: Karr at 30, Wapiti at 20, Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 = 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85-90. 

I believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team, which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set, did not want to repeat the old team’s mistakes from last year. 

Why will Wapiti results be good?

Paramount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter, and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August. Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region, which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year. Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount’s Wapiti region. Below is a map to show proximity:

📷

Paramount’s Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of \~15 months and IRRs of 45% at $55 oil. Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount’s Wapiti estimates:

* Paramount’s Karr region: directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here. Average returns are 64% with 18-month payouts. 
* NuVista’s Gold Creek acreage: directly west of Wapiti with 40% IRRs. Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve.
* Pipestone Energy’s acreage: directly north of Wapiti with 60% IRRs.

All IRRs referenced above assume a $55 WTI oil price. 

Potential asset sales: Given the age of the company, Paramount has plenty of assets (both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure) that they could sell. Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr. Karr is currently Paramount’s best land (64% IRRs referenced above) and inventory life is substantial. Below is my math on Karr’s potential infrastructure value.

Valuation

Upside: If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd, I estimate they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020. At $55 oil (WTI) and $5 condensate differentials, EBITDA would be \~$600m. (My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability). Subtracting debt of $800m, and assuming 5x EBITDA, equity value is over $2.2bn and $17/share. Shares are at $6.8 today. 

Downside: If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of $350m (most sell side is bearish/neutral on the stock) and apply a low 4x multiple, after subtracting $800m of debt the valuation target becomes $4.60/share. Downside is therefore \~30%. I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason (infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past). 

📷

Risks:

* Abandonment liability: Paramount has a \~$800m abandonment liability, which it pays out \~$30m per year. Recently in Alberta, the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt. As such, some investors are concerned that Paramount’s large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company’s liquidity. However, Paramount’s revolver does not mature until November of 2022. The company has drawn $800m on their $1.5bn revolver, and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim. I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020, and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022. 
* Guidance in 2019 is reduced – bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018, and the company’s track record of executing against guidance isn’t good. If, for whatever reason, Paramount reduces 2019 guidance (because Wapiti wells are below type curve, or infrastructure issues creep up again), I think downside to the stock is 30%. Please see my valuation section above. 
* Oil/gas prices – this risk is common to any oil and gas company. One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer. 

In the interest of full disclosure of potential conflicts, I work for a company that currently has a long position in Paramount Resources.  The opinions presented here are my own and are based on my research alone, and are not necessarily those of my employer.  There is no guarantee that the price targets I’ve modeled will be reached, and the share price could actually decrease depending on trading dynamics, company announcements, market conditions and other unknown factors.

Here is an overview for things to look out for this week regarding GME. Pray that Automod doesn't nuke me again.

🚀 **Option Chain Overview (As Of Close on Friday 3/19)**



Strike | Calls ITM | Puts ITM | Buying Power (# of Shares) | Total C&P ITM | % Calls | % Puts | Spread

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

These are the numbers of shorts that HF's can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.

233,DD Boomer Edition:Canadian Pacific to Merge with Kansas City Railroad. 🚂 I am autistic so I like the trains.,288,mabg4o,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mabg4o/dd_boomer_editioncanadian_pacific_to_merge_with/,86,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/railroads-strike-a-25-billion-merger-11616330332

Canadian Pacific has been trying to make a major purchase of a US railroad for years that would allow them a clean path between Mexico and Canada.  They want badly to be the USMCA railroad and have been put down by regulators multiple times despite raising cash for huge companies like Norfolk Southern.

US regulators have been blocking it because their buyouts would have arguably reduced market options and railroads are the one piece of semi-public assets the US still seems to be on board with protecting.  This small $25 billion dollar deal resolves the problem because instead of picking up a major rail network Canadian Pacific brokered a deal with a short line  🩳➖railroad service.  

In this case the Kansas City Southern is a very limited route with half of it's rail in mexico and it's US rail being simple long isolated stretches rather than the web a company like Norfolk provides.  So the primary regulatory concern is gone and from an international trade standpoint this would actually be a win.

Other Factors: 

Railroads are good recovery stocks.  Supply lines and distribution are a mess with back logs right now.  Ports are backed up, raw materials are missing and Texas getting shutdown by the storm hit a number of industries in that area hard.  Rail lines provide the ability to move large amounts of freight at lower prices than any other method on the globe.  

Railways are also increasingly green technology.  They were already the most efficient transportation method on the market but the technology keeps improving and railways has lots of incentive to adapt as energy costs are one of the major factors in their profits.  This means the industry likely doesn't see any pain coming out of the Biden administration and can likely get a piece of an alleged infrastructure bill.

Boomer Points:

Railways give dividends!  Thats extra money in your pocket.  Great secure industry that isn't going anywhere.  Millennials may be afraid of 🚂 but they need trains to move 🥑🍞 and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.   Rail is secure and GROWING.  

Railways are simple and easy to understand.  People need to move things and 🚂 are 💪 alone.  

This would literally be a new transcontinental railroad just in the other direction!  It is 🚂 history in the making!

Warnings : The last two merger attempts by CP failed.  This is their third shot at an end goal of getting direct access lines tied together between the USMCA counties.  Probably the most likely to succeed but no guarantee.

Rail is slow and that makes it vulnerable to other developments in the transit market (see self driving electric trucks).  The market is strong and showing promise but needs to push it's own technology forward to remain competitive long term.  Not to say they aren't trying but the auto industry has way more Engineers.

Positions;. Currently none.  Merger was announced today.  Calls are pricey but I'm going to try to buy in early Monday.  Rail is actually beating the market anyway.",2021-03-22 09:24:26
234,RKT's growth story shows up in its financials,284,macryp,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/,97,"I see many people compare RKT's forward P/E of around 12 to supposed peers like COF (Forward P/E 9.25), ESNT (7.38), PFSI (5.45), WD (12.2), UWMC (6.83), and claim that RKT is fairly valued or even overvalued. But I think that is a shallow comparison, given that [RKT is more than just a pureplay mortgage company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/). So what are some other metrics that we can use to compare these companies? One way is to also check their P/S, which is used a lot for growth companies that sometimes have losses and does not have a proper P/E. RKT has a P/S of 2.87, with a $45B market cap on $16B sales; what about these pure-play mortgage company peers?

COF - 2.26

ESNT - 5.24

PFSI - 0.99

WD - 3.14

UWMC - 3.99

So you can see here that RKT is middle of the pack. Why is it that RKT has average P/S valuation but high P/E valuation? The difference here is in spending - the higher expenses of RKT is making the EPS lower. What is RKT spending on and why does the spending make RKT stand out? They are reinvesting in the business - buying marketing, spending for infrastructure (they have a 2500 software team, larger than any of these other companies), acquiring other businesses, etc. You might argue and say maybe RKT is really inefficient and has a bunch of useless employees? Lets quickly check this: RKT has 20,000 employees and $16B sales, UWMC has 7000 employees and $3.62 sales, COF has 52,000 employees and $26B sales... you get the idea, RKT is pretty efficient with their staff.

So in the end, it's clear that based on sales, RKT is not overvalued. Their high P/E ratio is because they are reinvesting in the company, just as a growth company would do. Their investment in infrastructure and automation already clearly shows up in their staff efficiency.",2021-03-22 10:33:20

No need to be creative and interpret anything on this one - it doesn't get any clearer than this.

1.) Some of you might've seen the **Credit Suisse and William Blair Analyst Ratings for PLTR** \- Underperform with a Price Target of 20 as of February 16th 2021 (Reviewed and unchanged as of March 15th). Note that both those ratings were issued after the FY 2020 report dropped - so after seeing the 47% increase in revenues.

[The 2 Underperform Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/172gxd93lfo61.png?width=1404&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b4448e07eef9f839a156716e982e53f14db92849)

2.) Now guess who loaded up massively on PLTR shares for the last reporting date. I'm talking the **BIGGEST** relative position increase for the last reporting date - they didn't just double or tripple down, they quintupled down. Unfortunately I can't get the exact number of shares - but my best guess is that it's an Overweight position at this point (Edit: It makes up for 21% of CS Asset Management LLC‘s portfolio - Check Edit 2 - wowzaaaa)

[Credit Suisse with the BIGGEST relative position increase in the last reporting period - PLTR is CS Asset Management LLC‘s biggest position accounting for 21&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#37; of their Portfolio \(Check Edit 2 for more on that\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ci8uk87lfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=26d896e80c2f8fde57ad285d6f064a1c7e149181)

Now - in which subsidiary of Credit Suisse does said analyst Chew, Yaoxian work?

[He's a VP at Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC \(US\) - yep](https://preview.redd.it/zlfu1bxdlfo61.png?width=1819&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3ddbd45cd5ab4121ad880669fb51f4570bd19d30)

Little sidenote: If you had invested based on mister Chew's analysis, you would've made a whopping -8% return for the past 3 years! *Blacklisted the guy.*

Mister Bhavan's ratings don't look a lot better.

If you're reading this Chew - shame on you and if you wanna boost your accuracy and recommendation performance - maybe do your job and post an actual analysis, not just one that serves to spread negative sentiment in the hopes of lowering your cost basis. I bet you don't give two shits about actually doing your job though.

3.) Now let's have a look at William Blair's trades.

[No comment](https://preview.redd.it/3nbo9hmemfo61.png?width=1118&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=8cdc305208a842b497abb06c9a253501621be67f)

[Bhavan Suri's Ratings not looking too rosy either.](https://preview.redd.it/74w7rwxamfo61.png?width=1796&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=0d31456fba6a1716e9ab971fdccc01bb0fdfa536)

Let's have a look at William Blair's disclosure:

Officers and employees of William Blair or its affiliates (other than research analysts) mayhave a financial interest in the securities of Palantir Technologies Inc.. 

**(NO SHIT)**

This whole thing is just bullshit and I seriously question why these guys are even allowed to issue forecasts.

**TLDR:** 
CS and William Blair analysts are issuing sell/underperform ratings while massively loading up on PLTR stonks.

The only analysts I trust on this one are the GS analysts - the rest are full of BS, giving Sell recommendations while loading up on the respective stonks themselves. If you issue a sell recommendation, well then at least put your money where your mouth is. Not like mister Chew was just some low tier analyst who couldn't affect the decision of his firm to buy or sell PLTR shares - he's a VP at CS USA LLC - Chinese wall, my ass. **Their DDs and PTs are literally worthless.** Do your own DD, don't even look at the analyst ratings or if you do, look at their track record and question if they're pursuing some alterior motive. 
I've literally seen DDs on WSB that have been more accurate than these *professional* forecasts. This just goes to show that these guys are just trying to load up on more stonks at a lower cost basis by spreading negative sentiment. It's infuriating - I am legitimately pissed and hope that more people see this blatant bullshittery.

[At least Goldman gives honest ratings and their actions are in line with the recommendations they issue. - Issue a buy rating - load up on stonks. Issue a sell rating - sell the stonks. How fucking hard can it be.](https://preview.redd.it/zi72enzenfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3201e3eeb872eedba58f33ce9e1a797e240051b5)

**Edit: Valuation Concerns**

I see some people saying they're currently grossly over-valued. If compared to some of their peers I'd disagree, there might be some inflation but that's due to future expectations. 47% Sale's Growth last year, IBM partnering up with PLTR is bigger than it may sound at first glance - IBM has been in the game for decades and surely have the resources to create some beautiful things but they've given up competing against PLTR.

[If you look at the recently listed peers \(Snowflake, Datadog, Dynatrace\) - they're not as grossly overvalued as one might think given the hype they've gotten recently. They just have to \\""grow\\"" into that market cap and beyond, which I have no doubt they will. Also have a look at the EPS - the recently listed ones \(except for Dynatrace\) all have negative EPS \(PLTR in fact did have positive earnings at one point, but they're just re-investing everything and growing aggressively\).](https://preview.redd.it/vgmc4kiq2go61.png?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=6c0e3bf371c8d6fbc921d51905d710463af3fa82)

Also: if you deduct the stock based compensation from FY2020‘s net loss (which is sound as it‘s not a recurring cost), they‘ve actually netted a profit. I might do a more extensive DD on the Financials and have a deeper look into the shareholder‘s portfolios to show the conviction of the individual shareholders.

If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first company to ever get that level of clearance. That would attract other governments like the UK, France, Germany etc. (I bet some of those are already in discussions with PLTR). Government Contracts made up for around 50% of revenues last year. So even more revenue growth and more partnerships (which means higher revenue stability). They're also expanding into the private sector. I see a lot of upside but given the current market environment (high treasury yields - uncertainty about future inflation developments...) it might take a while.

u/Ada_Diamonds did a [great DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) on the future potential of PLTR - so just check that one out. It's not very financy, more from a practical PoV which imo makes more sense in valuating these companies - no way you'd value TSLA, PLTR, SNOW etc. with your traditional DCF/Multiples methods.

**Edit 2 - CS Securities USA and William Blair - Broker-Dealer/MM role:**

u/McKoijion brought up a fair point in saying that the aforementioned Credit Suisse subsidiary has a broker dealer role and hence does not hold those stonks to profit from them, they hold them to facilitate trade - which is partly true. The shares were acquired via Credit Suisse Securities and are currently held by CS Asset Management LLC who have a Low turnover rate (meaning they usually hold securities for a long period of time). Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC is the top 20th Institutional Shareholder. Their biggest position is PLTR (21% - the next largest position is ~10%, now that’s some insitutional YOLO like I’ve never seen it before. Obviously they’ll trade some shares to the other CS subsidiaries, I don’t expect them to have 20% of their portfolio in PLTR when the next filings get released). That imo has nothing to do with them being PLTR's IPO partners alongside GS and MS - neither GS nor MS have that weighting on PLTR stock.

As to William Blair - They're an actual Asset Manager, no MM or Broker-Dealer role there - pretty straightforward, they're just holding.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much(they grew around 30% CAGR for the last 5), it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

240,EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubble,985,m9zf3x,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9zf3x/ev_industry_a_spac_fueled_fraud_filled_bubble/,619,"So right now the **EV space** is starting to look **very similar** to what **weedstocks** were **in late 2018**. Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.

Related to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.

**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**

Some  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like ""Blaze It  Erryday Co"", ""Kush Money Inc"" and ""Aphria Inc"". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.

Turns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.

Sales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.

I  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.

* ""New"" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.
* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.
* Stonks going to the moon
* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.

Let's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.

**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary ""lifestyle experiences"". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.
* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.
* **Rating: Lol tier**

**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.
* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.
* **Rating: Crayon tier**

**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.
* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.
* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.
* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.
* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**

* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.
* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.
* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.
* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.
* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.
* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.
* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. ""tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY"", okay, right.

**In conclusion.**

Almost every single company in the ""purely"" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.

Thank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!

I know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.

Currently  I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated  TSLA puts. I am however looking into buying puts on the other EV  companies listed above.",2021-03-21 23:48:56

THIS IS NOT A GME REPLACEMENT, I don't want people to take out GME cash for this play (unless it's being used to fuel the rocket directly)

I've been using Annaly Capital (NLY)as a  hedge against the slight tech fall on Thursday, but here's the weird thing- Annaly goes up when SPY goes down (BUT) when SPY was going up its been shooting up a fuckton, this stock has an insanely low volume which leads to even the smallest of buys being able to shift the price up or down a significant amount. 

(be careful reading this next part since I'm retarted and don't know the technicals) (the retartedness actually applies to most of this not just the next part)

I don’t know the long-term ramifications of NLY, but what I do know is that it hasn't hit its peak and has the potential to at least be moved to twice what it's at right now by seeing its current trajectory and its former high. I also did a little research on the company

It’s a mortgage that pays out dividends to its stock owners (much like the RKT play) except as shown here, it had an insanely good 4th quarter-

A reminder that this isn't my long-play, that would be GME...but I do like this stock too  👀

But every day since the quarter results have been announced it's been increasing in price exponentially, so I have an inkling that by at least EOW (especially with WSB attention) it could be at 9.50,10$.

“But Jester, it’s at $8.95 right now, that's not that much movement???”

THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE IT GETS FUCKIN JUICY BROS.

LOOK AT THESE CALL PRICES.

[Once again, I hate robinhood and will be exiting once I sell these calls.](https://preview.redd.it/vce0r11rdfo61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0aa49c433755f576657422d1e7a3db00b6c1f44)

&#x200B;

0.05 for 9$ call when it's only fucking 8.95 right now, that's where this post has been going, this is a fucking 10bagger if the price shoots up this week with added volatility. For whatever reason, the premiums have not been catching up with the actual price and they've stayed very low for even ITM calls. 

But I get it. You want to play it safe, which is exactly why I think just purchasing the stock itself is a nice modest gain you can get for this week, yeah the stock isn’t going to shoot up to fuckin- 20, 30$ i don’t think. But going up 4-5$ is also insanely good and is better than getting cucked by stocks you think are going to go up 20-30$ only just to get slapped down a couple of bucks. (I’m looking at you UWMC) I wish no ill will to UWMC folk btw, but hot damn do I keep getting bested by that bad boy. Anyways, no one knows what's going to happen tomorrow, and I’m not a financial advisor, but I wanted to try my hand at researching my own stock to Yolo into, and here it is. Anyways positions: about 500 shares and 700\~ contracts. I’ll keep y'all up to date on how much I win/lose.

Here's a TL;DR

MiniMoon Opportunity, NLY- with proper visibility this could be a big Moon,

I waited until Sunday night to post this because I didn’t want too much attention from people with ill will who can slap it down with their bare hedgie hands, this is a sleeper hit I feel and if it blows up you don't want to be left wishing you could hop in.

243,$FSR is worth $0 a share,157,maa6g3,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/,127,"This stock will fly again due to hype, but it's a $0 company.  My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car.

Firstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.

Second, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.

Third, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.

Fourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?

Fifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?

Finally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.

I see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.
